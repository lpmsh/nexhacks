    "original_response": "The Black Death was a devastating plague pandemic in Europe from 1346 to 1353 that killed as many as 50 million people—around half of Europe's 14th-century population. Caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, it spread via infected fleas and through the air. The pandemic produced profound and lasting population loss and triggered major economic and cultural changes across Europe.",
    "compressed_response": "The Black Death was a catastrophic pandemic that struck Europe between about 1346 and 1353. Caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, it was primarily transmitted by infected fleas (often carried on rats) and in its pneumonic form could spread directly between people. The outbreak killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide and about half of Europe’s 14th‑century population.\n\nImpacts:\n- Demographic: massive population loss, labor shortages, and repeated local recurrences for centuries.\n- Economic: decline in agricultural output, higher wages for workers, shifts in land use, and weakening of the feudal manor system.\n- Social and political: social unrest, peasant revolts, and changes in social mobility as labor became more valuable.\n- Cultural and religious: rise in apocalyptic and penitential movements, loss of faith in some institutions, increased persecution of scapegoated groups (notably Jewish communities), and artistic themes of mortality (e.g., the danse macabre).\n- Medical and intellectual: challenges to existing medical theory, gradual advances in public health practices and record‑keeping.\n\nThe Black Death reshaped Europe’s demographic, economic and cultural landscape, accelerating long‑term changes that contributed to the transition from medieval to early modern society.",
