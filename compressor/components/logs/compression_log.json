It was one of the most fatal pandemics in human history; as many as 50 million people perished, perhaps 50% of Europe's 14th-century population. The disease is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and spread by fleas and through the air. The Black Death had far-reaching population, economic, and cultural impacts.",

    "original_response": "The Black Death (1346–1353) was a devastating pandemic caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis that killed as many as 50 million people—around half of Europe’s 14th-century population. Spread by infected fleas (and by pneumonic transmission between people), it produced profound demographic collapse and long-lasting economic and cultural changes across Europe.",
    "compressed_response": "The Black Death was the mid-14th‑century pandemic of bubonic (and pneumonic/septicemic) plague that swept Europe and surrounding regions, arriving in Europe via trade routes (often dated to 1347) and peaking through about 1351–1353 (some sources extend the period slightly). It was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, typically transmitted to humans by infected rat fleas and, in pneumonic form, directly between people. Mortality was enormous: estimates vary, but roughly 25–50 million people died in Europe—about a third to a half of the continent’s population at the time—and global deaths may have been much higher. The pandemic produced immediate social and economic upheaval: severe labor shortages, rising wages, disruption of agriculture and trade, food shortages in some areas, and crises of authority. It also provoked persecution of minorities, increased religiosity and apocalyptic thought, and deep cultural responses in art and literature. Longer-term effects included shifts in land use, pressures that helped weaken feudal structures, and changes in public health responses and demographic patterns that reshaped European society.",
