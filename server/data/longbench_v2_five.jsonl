China\u2019s Court System and Reform Process\nInstitutional Basis of Court Reform in China\nAccording to the Constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the \nOrganic Law of the People\u2019s Courts of the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nthe people\u2019s courts, as judicial organs of the State, exercise adjudicative \npower in accordance with laws independently, free from any interference \nby administrative organs, social organizations, and individuals. The State \nsets up the Supreme People\u2019s Court, local people\u2019s courts at different levels \nand special people\u2019s courts such as military courts. In accordance with laws, \nthese people\u2019s courts adjudicate civil, criminal and administrative cases and \nother cases prescribed by laws, and carry out judicial activities including the \nexecution of civil and administrative decisions. Sole judges, collegial panels, \njudicial committees, and compensation committees are the judicial organs \nprescribed by laws.\nThe Supreme People\u2019s Court, as the highest judicial organ of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, is responsible for adjudicating various cases that have \nmaterial effects nationwide or are subject to its adjudication according to \nlaw, formulating judicial interpretations, supervising and guiding the judicial \nwork of local people\u2019s courts at different levels and special people\u2019s courts, \nand managing certain judicial administration work of the courts nationwide \nwithin the scope of its functions and powers as per laws.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   68\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n69\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nLocal people\u2019s courts at different levels include primary people\u2019s courts, \nintermediate people\u2019s courts and higher people\u2019s courts. Special people\u2019s \ncourts include military courts, maritime courts, IP courts, financial courts, \netc.\nA people\u2019s court at a higher level supervises the judicial work of the people\u2019s \ncourts at the next lower level. In litigious activities, the people\u2019s courts adopt \nthe systems of public trial, collegiate panel, challenge, people\u2019s assessors, \ndefense, and judgment of the second instance as final, etc.\nBasic Process of Court Reform in China\nSince the introduction of the reform and opening-up policy, along with \nall-round economic and social development, continuous advancement of \ndemocracy and rule by law, and the public\u2019s ever-increasing demands for \nand expectations of judicature, the original judicial system has become \nunable to meet the need of new situations. As early as in the 1990s, China\u2019s \ncourts started the reforms focusing on enhancing the function of court trials, \nexpanding the openness of trials and improving judicial professionalization. \nSince the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (\u201cCPC\u201d), \nthe Supreme People\u2019s Court has initiated a series of reforms in the areas \nof organization and system of courts, judge system, litigation procedure, \nmethod of trial, enforcement system, judicial management, etc., and \npromulgated three \u201cFive-year Reform Program for People\u2019s Courts\u201d in 1999, \n2005 and 2009 respectively. The said three Programs served as the basis of \nChina\u2019s court reform before 2013.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   69\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n70\n-\n-\nThe Decision of the Central Committee of the CPC (\u201cCCCPC\u201d) on Some \nMajor Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform adopted \nat the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th CCCPC set an important task of \nadvancing rule by law in China and deepening the reform of the judicial \nsystem. The Decision of the CCCPC on Some Major Issues Concerning \nManagement of State Affairs under the Rule of Law in an All-round Way \nadopted at the 4th Plenary Session of the 18th CCCPC set the establishment \nof a socialist system of rule by law with Chinese characteristics and the \nbuilding of a socialist country under the rule of law as the general objective \nof advancing management of state affairs under the rule of law in an all-\nround way, and put forward a series of major reform measures in scientific \nlegislation, strict law enforcement, judicial impartiality, universal law \nabiding and other areas. The judicial reform has become an important \ncomponent of the program of comprehensively deepening the reform in \nChina and has been included in the overall development strategy of the \nState.\nIn order to further deepening the reform of people\u2019s courts, the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court promulgated the Opinions on Comprehensively Deepening \nthe Reform of People\u2019s Courts on February 4, 2015, putting forward 65 \nreform measures, which was served as the Fourth Five-year Reform \nProgram for People\u2019s Courts 2014-2018. As of the end of 2018, 65 reform \ntasks had been carried out in an all-round way, 256 reform documents had \nbeen formulated. Among these reform documents, 173 were issued by the \nSupreme People\u2019s Court separately, 46 were issued by it jointly with the \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   70\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n71\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nrelated departments of the Central Government, and 37 were formulated \nwith its promotion or participation.\nAt the 19th National Congress of the CPC, major strategic arrangement was \nmade as follows: \u201cdeepening the comprehensive and supporting reform of \nthe judicial system and fully implementing the judicial accountability system \nso that people can experience fairness and justice in each case\u201d, which \nmarks a new stage of the judicial system reform. Based on the realities of \ncourts, the Supreme People\u2019s Court formulated the Opinions on Deepening \nthe Comprehensive and Supporting Reform of the Judicial System in the \nPeople\u2019s Courts, namely the Fifth Five-Year Reform Program for People\u2019s \nCourts 2019-2023 as an important program for instructing the people\u2019s \ncourts to deepen the comprehensive and supporting reform of the judicial \nsystem in the next five years.\nOrganization and Implementation of the Court Reform in China\nIn early 2014, China set up the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively \nDeepening Reform headed by President Xi Jinping, which is responsible \nfor the overall design, arrangement, coordination, promotion and \nimplementation of the reform. In March 2018, it was renamed as the \nCentral Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission. Between \nJanuary 22, 2014 and December 31, 2018, the Central Leading Group for \nComprehensively Deepening Reform (hereinafter referred to as \u201cCLGCDR\u201d) \nand the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission \n(hereinafter referred to as \u201cCCDRC\u201d), in aggregate, held 45 meetings, \nconsidered and passed 35 documents relating to important reforms of \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   71\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n72\n-\n-\npeople\u2019s courts.\nThe CCDRC has six special sub-groups, which are responsible for \nconsidering important issues relating to reforms in the relevant areas, \ncoordinating and advancing the formulation and implementation of special \nreform policies and measures. The Leading Group for Reform of the Social \nSystem (also called Central Leading Group for Reform of the Judicial \nSystem) is responsible for deepening the reform of the judicial system.\nThe reform of the judicial system covers a wide range of issues and has \nhigh policy sensitivity. In consideration that the improvement of classified \nmanagement of judicial personnel, improvement of judicial accountability, \nimprovement of job security of judicial personnel and promotion of \ncentralized management of personnel, financial and material resources of \nlocal courts below the provincial level are basic measures of the reform \nof the judicial system, according to the principle that major reforms shall \nbe first conducted on a pilot basis, China launched pilot reforms in respect \nof the aforesaid four issues in some provinces, autonomous regions and \nmunicipalities directly under the Central Government in three batches, to \naccumulate experience for advancing the reform in an all-round way. Since \nJune 2014, the first judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in 7 \nprovinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, namely \nShanghai, Jilin, Hubei, Guangdong, Hainan, Guizhou, and Qinghai. Since \nJune 2015, the second judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in \n11 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central \nGovernment, namely Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   72\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n73\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nZhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Shandong, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Ningxia. Since \nMarch 2016, the third judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in \nBeijing and other 13 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly \nunder the Central Government and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region \nProduction and Construction Corps. Since July 2016, these four major \nreforms have been implemented nationwide in an all-round way. \nThe Supreme People\u2019s Court set up a leading group for judicial reform \nheaded by Chief Judge Zhou Qiang, responsible for organizing, leading, \narranging, and coordinating the judicial reform of courts, holding plenary \nand special meetings, overall planning of key issues of reform, considering \nreform proposals, discussing and deciding on major issues. Each higher \npeople\u2019s court sets up a leading group for judicial reform, responsible for \nsupervising, guiding, arranging, and coordinating the judicial reform of \ncourts within its jurisdiction. Each higher people\u2019s court\u2019s proposal of pilot \nprogram for judicial reform is subject to examination and approval by the \nSupreme People\u2019s Court, and if it involves any major reform, by the Central \nGovernment.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   73\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n74\n-\n-\nII. Fully Implementing the Judicial Accountability System\nIt is both an objective requirement of the law of justice and a core content \nof the reform of the judicial system that one who tries a case shall have the \npower to decide the case and be responsible for his decision. In September \n2015, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued certain opinions on improving \nthe judicial accountability system in the people\u2019s courts, establishing a \nnew type of operating mechanism of adjudicative power, to instruct the \ncourts nationwide to advance the reform of the judicial accountability \nsystem. In December 2018, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued opinions on \nfurther comprehensively implementing the judicial accountability system, \nproviding more guidance on issues such as improving the mechanism of \ntrial supervision and management and the mechanism of unified application \nof law, to promote full implementation of the judicial accountability \nsystem. Since the full implementation of the judicial accountability system \nreform, in courts nationwide, the number of first-line judicial personnel has \nincreased over 20%, the average number of cases handled by each person \nhas increased over 20%, and the rate of conclusion of cases has increased \nover 18%.\nImplementing accountability system for sole judges and collegiate \npanels handling cases. Fully respecting the status of sole judges and \ncollegiate panels as statutory judicial organs, most of the courts at all levels \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   74\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n75\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nhave established an accountability system in which \u201cone who tries a case \nshall have the power to decide the case and be responsible for his decision\u201d, \nand have revoked the system of asking for instructions and examination and \napproval level by level. The written judgments formed through adjudication \nby collegiate panels or sole judges are issued upon signature by collegiate \npanel members or sole judges. Except the cases considered and decided \nby the judicial committees, court/tribunal presidents no longer review or \nsign the written judgments on the cases of which they have not directly \nparticipated in the trial. Since the reform, in courts nationwide, the number \nof cases on which the judgments are directly made by sole judges and \ncollegiate panels has reached over 98% of the total number of cases, and \nthe number of cases referred to judicial committees for discussion has fallen \nsharply. In Shanghai, since the launch of the reform, the ratio of the cases \ndirectly decided by the sole judges or collegiate panels has reached 99.99%, \nand only 0.1% of the cases concluded have been submitted to the judicial \ncommittees for discussion.\nFlexibly organizing the judicial team. According to laws and based \non actual circumstances, the primary people\u2019s courts organize judicial \nteams with judge as the core member, and judge assistant, clerk and other \nauxiliary judicial personnel as the supporting members, describe the duties \nof judges, judge assistants and clerks, and improve the case handling \nmechanism with clear power and responsibility, consistency between power \nand responsibility, both division and cooperation, and orderly operation, \nby taking into overall consideration the separation of complicated cases \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   75\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n76\n-\n-\nfrom simple ones and the specialization of adjudication. By following the \nidea of separating complicated cases from simple ones, Chaoyang District \nPeople\u2019s Court in Beijing has organized 26 quick-track sentencing teams \nfor simple cases, each of which concludes over 650 cases annually, and \n45 specialized judicial teams for finance, intellectual property rights, real \nestate, bankruptcy and other meticulous trial of complicated cases, which \nhave fairly tried a large number of major doubtful and complicated cases. \nFutian District People\u2019s Court in Shenzhen, Guangdong, has created a new \nmode of organizing judicial team as follows: in a quick-track sentencing, \nquick trial and quick enforcement team, each judge is supported by multiple \nassistants; in an ordinary judicial team, there are 3 relatively fixed basic \ncase-handling units, each of which consists of 1 judge and 2 assistants, so \nthat the judicial team is both stable and flexible and the judicial resources \nallocation is optimized. In 2018, all kinds of judicial teams in this court \nconcluded 107,301 cases, with a YoY increase of 16.32%, and the quality \nand efficiency of trial continuously improved.\nReforming the case allocation mechanism. The courts at all levels have \nestablished a case allocation mechanism where random allocation plays a \nmajor role and assignment a supporting role. Cases are randomly allocated \nto judges based on the area and complexity of cases. If the judge handling \na case needs to be replaced due to challenge or due to job transfer, health, \nrisk of corruption, etc., the replacement is subject to review and approval \nby relevant court/tribunal president, and the replacement result shall be \nnotified to the litigants in a timely manner and made public on the working \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   76\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n77\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nplatform. The courts in Shanghai have formulated guidelines on random and \nautomated allocation of cases and has realized random allocation of civil \nand commercial cases. The Suburb People\u2019s Court in Sanya, Hainan has \nintroduced an automated case allocation system, whereby, after scientifically \npresetting saturated workload of judges, cases are randomly allocated \nupon automated calculation of workload based on case-handling quota \nand unconcluded cases of judges, to address the problem of unbalanced \nallocation of cases through informatization.\nInnovating the auxiliary trial work mode. The courts at all levels \nhave organized work teams specializing in service of process, property \npreservation, enforcement examination and control, document uploading, \nonline announcement and other affairs. They manage auxiliary trial affairs \nin a centralized way to improve work efficiency. The courts in Beijing, \nShanghai, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong, etc. actively explore ways of \nhandling notice service, material scanning, file filing and other auxiliary \naffairs by purchasing social services, to improve the efficiency of handling \ncases with the aid of external service providers. Shenzhen Intermediate \nPeople\u2019s Court in Guangdong has formulated guidelines on courts\u2019 purchase \nof social services, setting out the scope, procedures, and standards for courts \nto purchase social services, and listing seven categories of 41 services which \nmay be outsourced in litigation service, adjudication and enforcement, \ncourt management, logistics support, judicial transparency, informatization, \nculture construction, and other areas. In 2018, by outsourcing mediation \nassistance service, it successfully mediated 15,829 disputes before litigation; \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   77\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n78\n-\n-\nby using social services, it scanned hard-copy materials and generated soft-\ncopy ones of over 200,000 cases, constantly improving the efficiency of \nhandling cases. Siming District People\u2019s Court and Lujiang Notary Public \nOffice in Xiamen, Fujian has created the first litigation-notary collaborative \ninnovation center in China, clarifying that notary offices may assist people\u2019s \ncourts with procedural and auxiliary judicial services.\nImproving the mechanism for regular handling of cases by court/\ntribunal presidents. The courts nationwide have implemented the judge \nquota system. According to the requirements that registered judges must \nhandle cases, the presidents (including vice presidents) of courts/tribunals \nat all levels generally engage again in trial work upon registration as judge. \nIn April 2017, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued guidelines on further \npromoting the presidents of courts/tribunals at all levels registered as judges \nto handle cases, establishing a mechanism for strict constraint, evaluation \nand supervision on case-handling by court/tribunal presidents and improving \nthe mechanism for court officials mainly to adjudicate major doubtful and \ncomplicated cases, to give full play to the exemplary and leading role of \ncourt/tribunal presidents in handling cases. In 2018, in Jiangsu, the number \nof cases adjudicated by court/tribunal presidents as handling judge or chief \njudge accounted for 50.84% of the total number of cases before the courts \nacross the province. \nImproving the new trial management and supervision mechanism. In \nApril 2017, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued opinions on implementation \nof the judicial accountability system and improvement of the trial \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   78\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n79\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nsupervision and management mechanism to instruct the courts at all levels \nto improve the new supervision and management system. The courts at all \nlevels have formulated a list of powers and responsibilities of court/tribunal \npresidents and related regulations to set out the scope and method for court/\ntribunal presidents to exercise their power to supervise and manage trials, \nand to actively build a supervision and management mechanism covering \nthe entire court, all staff, and whole process through informatization. The \ncourt/tribunal presidents may only express their opinions on specific cases \npublicly through professional judge meetings and the judicial committee, \nand such opinions shall be wholly recorded on the working platform, so that \npowers are delegated without indulgence and exercised under supervision. \nThe courts in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Sichuan and other regions, by \nrelying on artificial intelligence and big data, explore how to achieve online \nsupervision through automated recognition, labeling, system recommending, \nnode control, authority freezing and other means. Tianjin Higher People\u2019s \nCourt issued 29 categories of judicial standards in four batches covering \nadjudication process, power exercise, judicial transparency, litigation service \nand other areas. Chengdu Intermediate People\u2019s Court in Sichuan, by closely \ncentering on five major links of case filing, adjudication, conclusion, appeal, \nand enforcement, and relying on online working platform, has achieved \nsilent supervision on 183 work nodes and 68 monitoring nodes, in order to \nassist judges in handling cases.\nImproving the chief judge meeting system. Most of the courts at all levels \nhave established the chief judge meeting system to provide judges with \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   79\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n80\n-\n-\nadvice on correct application of law and provide opinions for reference by \ncollegiate panels. In December 2018, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued \nguidelines on improving the working mechanism of chief judge meetings \nin people\u2019s courts to improve the rules of procedure of professional judge \nmeetings. Chongqing No. 2 Intermediate People\u2019s Court has established \nthe systems of joint meeting of judges in the tribunals and the cross-\ndepartmental meeting of judges, with the number of cases submitted to \nthe judicial committee for discussion being reduced by 42% year on year, \nthereby giving full play to the service and consultation functions of the \nmeetings of judges and the function of filtration of the cases submitted to the \njudicial committee for discussion.\nReforming the system of judicial committee. The Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt has formulated guidelines to strengthen the function of the judicial \ncommittees in summarizing experience in adjudication, unifying the \napplication of law and discussing and deciding on major issues in respect of \nadjudication.

Advancing the Reform of Organizational Structure of \nCourts\nImproving an optimized, coordinated and efficient organizational system \nand functional system of courts is an important part and goal of the \njudicial reform of the people\u2019s courts, and an important support for the \nmodernization of judicial system and judicial capability. Since 2013, China\u2019s \ncourts have actively promoted the reform of organizational system and \ninternal organs of courts, optimized the jurisdiction and power allocation, \nand promoted the combination of specialized trials and flat management, \nlaying a solid foundation for serving the big picture, exercising judicial \npower for the people, and judicial impartiality.\nSetting up Circuit Courts of the Supreme People\u2019s Court. At the end \nof January 2015, the Supreme People\u2019s Court set up No. 1 and 2 Circuit \nCourts in Shenzhen and Shenyang respectively; at the end of December \n2016, it set up No. 3, 4, 5 and 6 Circuit Courts in Nanjing, Zhengzhou, \nChongqing and Xi\u2019an respectively. These Circuit Courts of the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court, as standing local judicial organs dispatched by the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court, adjudicate the cases assigned by the Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt according to law. The judgments and rulings made by these Circuit \nCourts have the equal effect as those made by the Supreme People\u2019s Court. \nSince their establishment and as of the end of 2018, the six Circuit Courts \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   86\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n87\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nhave concluded 33,335 cases, accounting for 50.35% of the total number \nof cases concluded by the Supreme People\u2019s Court, and have received a \ntotal of 117,090 visitors who brought complaints and appeals before them \nand resolved relevant disputes before litigation. By vigorously carrying out \nthe circuit adjudication and actively innovating working mechanism, these \nCircuit Courts have effectively realized the original intention to delegate the \nadjudicative power, facilitate initiation of lawsuits by the people, improved \nwork efficiency, effectively promoted social harmony and stability, and \nserved and protected the rule of law in respective circuits, thus being \nnicknamed by the people as the \u201csupreme people\u2019s court at the doorstep\u201d, \nplaying an important role in improving the socialist judicial system with \nChinese characteristics and promoting the rule of law in a comprehensive \nmanner.\nEnhancing the construction of a specialized IP judicial system. In order \nto further enhance judicial protection of intellectual property rights (IP) \nand unifying the adjudicative criteria for IP cases, with the approval by \nthe Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, IP courts were \nestablished in Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai on November 6, December \n16 and December 28, 2014 respectively. The Supreme People\u2019s Court has \nissued the relevant judicial interpretations, defining the jurisdiction of IP \ncourts over cases, and providing guidelines on the appointment of IP judges, \nparticipation in litigious activities by technological investigation officers of \nIP courts and other issues. The IP courts have built a new image of China \nin judicial protection of IP through fair adjudication of typical cases, timely \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   87\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n88\n-\n-\npublication of typical cases and otherwise. As of the end of 2018, these \nthree IP courts had accepted a total of 90,578 cases and concluded 74,007 \ncases. In addition, the Supreme People\u2019s Court has also promoted the \nestablishment of 19 IP courts in 16 provinces and cities such as Jiangsu, in \norder to realize centralized jurisdiction over some IP cases across regions. \nOn January 1, 2019, the IP Tribunal of the Supreme People\u2019s Court, which \nwas established according to the decision of the Standing Committee of the \nNational People\u2019s Congress, was officially opened, for unified adjudication \nof highly professional and technical civil and administrative appeals such \nas those involving patent, to form a national mechanism for adjudicating IP \nappeals. The above-mentioned reform measures have effectively promoted \nthe specialized adjudication of, centralized jurisdiction over, and intensified \nprocedures for IP cases, and improved the IP judicial system with Chinese \ncharacteristics.\nLaunching pilot reform of trans-regional courts in Beijing and \nShanghai. In order to ensure lawful and fair adjudication of trans-regional \ncases, the Beijing No. 4 Intermediate People\u2019s Court and the Shanghai No. \n3 Intermediate People\u2019s Court were established in Beijing and Shanghai \nrespectively in December 2014, as pilot trans-regional people\u2019s courts, \nthrough which experience has been accumulated in exploring how to establish \na new pattern of litigation system in which general cases are adjudicated \nat local courts and special cases are adjudicated at trans-regional courts. \nThese two courts are responsible for adjudicating major civil, commercial, \nadministrative, environmental and resource protection, food and drug safety \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   88\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n89\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nand certain criminal cases involving different administrative regions, to \nensure fair adjudication of cases involving local interests. From 2015 to \n2018, the number of first-instance administrative cases brought against a \ndistrict/county government and subject to the centralized jurisdiction of \nand accepted by the Beijing No. 4 Intermediate People\u2019s Court increased \nby 650%. As appointed by the Supreme People\u2019s Court, from October 26, \n2017, this court began to accept the appeals of environmental-protection \nadministrative cases adjudicated by relevant courts in Tianjin, marking \nan important step in cross-provincial jurisdiction of cases. The number of \nadministrative cases accepted by the Shanghai No. 3 Intermediate People\u2019s \nCourt increases by over 30% per year. In 2018, the number of settled and \ndropped administrative cases before this court increased by 126.67% over \nthe previous year. These two trans-regional courts have fairly adjudicated a \nseries of cases with major social impacts, effectively addressing the issue of \n\u201cat home v. away in litigation\u201d and enhancing the public credibility of the \njudiciary.\nSetting up Shanghai Financial Court. According to the decision of the \nStanding Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, on August 20, \n2018, Shanghai Financial Court was formally established with special \njurisdiction over finance-related civil-commercial cases and finance-related \nadministrative cases subject to the jurisdiction of an Intermediate People\u2019s \nCourt. The Supreme People\u2019s Court has issued judicial interpretations, \nclarifying the specific jurisdiction of the Shanghai Financial Court. As of \nthe end of 2018, Shanghai Financial Court had accepted 1,897 cases, with a \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   89\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n90\n-\n-\ntotal subject value of RMB 25.2 billion, mainly involving disputes related \nto liability for misrepresentation as to securities, financial loan contracts, \ncorporate bond trading, repurchase of pledged securities, financial leasing \ncontracts, for-profit trust, etc.\nSetting up Internet courts in Hangzhou, Beijing and Guangzhou. \nInternet court is a major institutional innovation whereby China\u2019s courts \nactively address the judicial needs in the Internet era and implement the \nInternet power strategy. On August 18, 2017, September 9, 2018, and \nSeptember 28, 2018, Hangzhou Internet Court, Beijing Internet Court, and \nGuangzhou Internet Court were successively established. In September \n2018, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued judicial interpretations of trials \nbefore Internet courts, clarifying the jurisdiction, appeal mechanism, online \nlitigation rules, and requirements for construction of litigation platform \nof Internet Courts. Internet Courts have actively promoted the \u201conline \nresolution of online disputes\u201d and facilitated the online verification of \nlitigant\u2019s identity, online collection of evidentiary materials, online service \nof legal instruments, etc., thus significantly improving judicial efficiency. \nIn Hangzhou Internet Court, the online case-filing rate has reached 89.2%, \nthe online court-session rate has reached 59.9%, the online case-concluding \nrate has reached 83.6%, the online trial session has averaged 28 minutes, \nand the trial period has averaged 41 days, saving 60% and 50% of the time \nrespectively compared with the traditional trial mode.

Strengthening the System and Mechanism of Judicial \nProtection of Human Rights\nTo respect and protect human rights is an important principle set forth in the \nConstitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and an important content \nof the socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics. China\u2019s courts \nhave achieved positive results in the development of the mechanism of \njudicial protection of human rights through pushing forward the reform of \nthe criminal litigation system centering on trials, strictly implementing the \nlegal principles that crimes shall be punished only under the law, judgments \nshall be made upon evidence and presuming innocent until proven guilty, \nactively preventing cases in which people are unjustly, falsely or wrongly \ncharged or sentenced, protecting the lawyers\u2019 right to practice according \nto law, achieving positive results in building the mechanism of judicial \nprotection of human rights.\nPushing forward the reform of the criminal litigation system centering \non trials. The Supreme People\u2019s Court, in conjunction with the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of \nState Security and the Ministry of Justice, issued the guidelines on pushing \nforward the reform of the criminal litigation system centering on trials and \nthe documents on strictly excluding illegal evidence in handling of criminal \ncases.

In these exemplary court trials, a total of 1,469 witnesses, including \n818 general witnesses, 114 appraisers, 455 investigators, 17 experts, and \n65 victims, testified before courts. Wenzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court in \nZhejiang has improved the mechanism for protecting personnel testifying \nbefore court, issued detailed rules on investigators\u2019 appearance in court \nas witnesses, provided remote rooms for offering testimonies, devices for \nconcealing faces of witnesses and other appropriate facilities, established the \nmechanism for protecting the rights and interests of witnesses in conjunction \nwith the public security and procuratorial organs, and formulated the \nstandard of subsidies for witnesses testifying before court.

With the authorization of the Standing Committee \nof the National People\u2019s Congress, since August 26, 2014, China has \nlaunched a two-year pilot reform on quick-track sentencing procedure for \ncriminal cases in 217 primary courts in Beijing and 17 other cities. During \nthe period of the pilot reform, the pilot courts tried and concluded 52,540 \ncriminal cases using the quick-track sentencing procedure, involving 54,572 \ndefendants in total, accounting for 35.88% of criminal cases in which not \nmore than one-year sentences were pronounced by such pilot courts in the \nsame period, and 18.48% of the criminal cases tried by such pilot courts \nin the same period; among such cases, 95.35% were concluded within 10 \ndays, 65.04 percent higher than those subject to the summary procedure, and \nthe judgments on 96.05% of such cases were announced at the court, 41.22 \npercent higher than those subject to the summary procedure. Haidian District \nPeople\u2019s Court in Beijing has explored the mode of whole-course quick-track \nsentencing procedure to effectively reduce the time of circulation of cases \nat all the stages. Under the said mode, the average duration of the judicial \nprocedure in which the defendants were under detention was 33 days, about \n70% shorter than that of the similar cases concluded using the summary \nprocedure prior to the reform. Among all the cases subject to the quick-track \nsentencing procedure, the rate of plaintiffs filing appeals who also lodged \ncivil lawsuits was 0, the rate of defendants filing appeals was 2.01%, the rate \nof procuratorial organs filing protests was only 0.01%, and the overall rate \nof filing appeals or protests was 9.52 percent lower than that of the criminal \ncases taken as a whole.

Through shortening pre-trial detention and passing sentences on \ndefendants quickly and leniently, the quick-track sentencing procedure can \ngive full play to the function of social correction, and help the offenders \nreform themselves and return to the society. In September 2016, the 22nd \nSession of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People\u2019s Congress \nreviewed a report on the pilot reform, fully affirmed the efforts in these \npilot reforms, and decided to incorporate the pilot reform of quick-track \nsentencing procedure for criminal cases into the pilot reform of imposing \nlenient penalties on those who admit their guilt and accept punishments \nand to continue the pilot reform. Between September 2016 and September \n2018, a total of 281 pilot courts was identified, and 205,510 criminal cases \nwere concluded by applying the system of imposing lenient penalties on \nthose who admit their guilt and accept punishments, accounting for 53.5% \nof the criminal cases concluded by the pilot courts during this period. On \nOctober 26, 2018, at the 6th Session of the Standing Committee of the 13th \nNational People\u2019s Congress, a decision was made on amending the Criminal \nProcedure Law to incorporate the achievements made in the pilot reform \nof imposing lenient penalties on those who admit their guilt and accept \npunishments into the newly amended Criminal Procedure Law and promote \nthem nationwide.\nDeepening the reform on standardization of sentencing. At the end \nof 2013, the Supreme People\u2019s Court promulgated the guidelines on \nmeasurement of penalty by people\u2019s courts to regulate the judges\u2019 discretion \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   98\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n99\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nin measurement of penalty, which require setting up an independent debate \nprocedure regarding measurement of penalty, and promoting standardization \nof measurement of penalty throughout the country. In 2016, the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court further extended the kinds of charges and punishments under \nthe pilot program on standardization of measurement of penalty by including \ndangerous driving and other seven charges into the scope of application of \nthe pilot program and extending the kinds of punishment from imprisonment \nand criminal detention to fines and probation. The Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt designated some courts to carry out the pilot program to ensure the \nstandardization of measurement of penalty and the punishment meted out \nbeing appropriate to the crime committed. With this reform implemented, \nthe methodology in sentencing has become more standardized and scientific, \nand the sentences received have become fairer and more balanced, bringing \nabout a procedure with more transparency and fairness. \nStrictly regulating commutation of punishment, parole and temporary \nexecution of sentences outside prison. In April 2014, the Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt issued the judicial interpretations regarding the hearing procedures \nfor commutation of punishment and parole, requiring establishment of the \nsystem of public hearing on commutation of punishment and parole and the \nsystem of periodic publication of typical cases. In 2015, the information \nwebsite on the cases of commutation of punishment, parole and temporary \nexecution of sentences outside prison granted by the courts nationwide was \nopened, to publicize the information of the whole process from case filing \nto judgment entering of the cases involving commutation of punishment and \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   99\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n100\n-\n-\nparole, so that commutation of punishment and parole is conducted under \nthe supervision of the public.

As of the end of 2018, the courts nationwide had publicized \n12.88 million blacklisted dishonest persons, out of which 17.46 million \nreservations of air tickets and 5.47 million of bullet train or high-speed rail \ntickets were rejected. 3.51 million dishonest persons subject to enforcement \nhave fulfilled their obligations under such pressure.\nPromoting online judicial auctions. In order to overcome the shortcomings \nof conventional auction methods, the Supreme People\u2019s Court, absorbing \nand distilling the experiences of online judicial auctions in lower courts,  has \nestablished a new judicial auction mode that online auctions are general and \ntraditional auctions are exceptional, and promulgated judicial interpretations \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   122\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n123\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nregarding online judicial auctions, requiring full promotion of online judicial \nauctions nationwide and improvement of related supporting systems from \nJanuary 1, 2017. Up to now, 92.5% of the courts nationwide (namely 3,260 \ncourts) have fully adopted online auctions, and over 80% of the judicial \nauctions have been conducted online. Owing to the implementation of \nonline judicial auctions, the successful auction rate and premium rate have \nincreased exponentially, and the rate of failed auction and price reduction as \nwell as the auction costs has dropped significantly. Online actions effectively \neliminate the rent-seeking probabilities, cut off the illegal interest chain, \nand bring about \u201czero complaint\u201d about violation of laws and disciplines \nduring auctions. From its launch in March 2017 to December 2018, the \ncourts nationwide have conducted over 940,000 online auctions and thereby \nsold over 270,000 items for RMB 604.9 billion, with successful auction rate \nof 70.8% and premium rate of 64.3%, and saving commissions of RMB \n18.6 billion for litigants. To tackle the low efficiency of appraisal during \njudicial auctions, courts nationwide have diversified methods of appraisal \nsuch as bargaining between litigants, targeted inquiries, online inquiries \nand entrusted appraisals, and have established a unified online appraisal \nplatform. With appraisals becoming more standardized and informatized, \nthe efficiency of property disposal has been improved and the burden on \nlitigants has been alleviated.\nImproving the management of enforcements. Since 2013, the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court has been striving for a normative enforcement system, and \nhas promulgated 55 judicial interpretations and regulatory documents in this \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   123\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n124\n-\n-\nregard. In particular, since 2016, 37 judicial interpretations and regulatory \ndocuments regulating property preservation, property investigation, \nenforcement settlement, enforcement guaranty, presupposed arbitration \nand other issues have been promulgated to strengthen the system, reify the \nrules, and effectively restrain and regulate the enforcement-related power. \nSince 2014, the courts nationwide have carried out a comprehensive check \non the enforcement cases pending in the past 20 years, and entered over \n16 million cases into the enforcement case management system, laying \na solid foundation for an orderly, precise, comprehensive and intelligent \nmanagement of the enforcement cases. A new mode of enforcement \nmanagement has been established to put all courts in this country under \n\u201cunified management, unified coordination, and unified command\u201d, \ntransforming the management into a new flat structure being more \nintensified, visualized, standardized, and intelligent. A unified enforcement \ncase handling platform has been established so that all the enforcement \nofficers nationwide work on the same platform, harmonizing the standards \nand procedures for enforcement cases, and strengthening the control over \nkey nodes. An unified enforcement command and management platform \nhas been established. With its nearly 20 functions including enforcement \ncoordination, property management, complaints and appeals, and proceeding \nsupervision, this platform realized the progress that enforcement information \ncan be publicized at \u201cone-stop\u201d and case handling can be pressed via \u201cone-\nclick\u201d. In response to the difficulties in overseeing the handling of letters \nand visits involving enforcement, the unified system also included all the \ninformation of letters and visits involving enforcement, through which the \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   124\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n125\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nentire process of handling is recorded, traceable, and managed precisely.\nDeepening the reform of the enforcement system and mechanisms. \nThe pilot reform of the separation of adjudication power and enforcement \npower within the people\u2019s courts has been advanced actively and steadily. \nThe Supreme People\u2019s Court has promulgated opinions on improving \ncoordination of case filing, adjudication and enforcement, in order to \nstrengthen the interactive engagements between case filing, adjudication, \nenforcement and preservation procedures. A team-based working structure \nhas been established with judges as the team leader and legal assistants, \nclerks, judicial police and other auxiliary judicial personnel as the supporting \nmembers, which maximizes the utility of human resources for enforcement. \nThe practice that property preservation applicants obtain insurance from \nprofessional insurers has been comprehensively promoted, which backs \napplicants struggling to provide collaterals and contributes to the increase of \napplications of property preservation measures. In response to the deficit of \nthe judicial assistance fund, the Supreme People\u2019s Court, on the basis of the \napproved pilot projects in Ningbo courts, has explored methods to expand \nthe capital source, such as insuring the judicial assistance funds. In 2018, the \ngranted judicial assistance fund amounted to RMB 650 million.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   125\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n126\n-\n-\nVII. Deepening Judicial Openness and Judicial Democracy\nOpenness is the best means of anti-corruption. Since 2013, according \nto an overall integrated arrangement, by upholding to the principle of \nlegality, voluntary, comprehensive  and substantive disclosure, the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court has been simultaneously promoting the construction of four \ndisclosure platforms for judicial process, court trials, written judgments, \nand enforcement procedures to improve judicial openness and transparency. \nUnder the principle that disclosure is the general rule unless it meets the \nexceptional conditions defined by law, it has been promoting judicial \nopenness in all areas and at all links of the adjudication and enforcement by \nthe people\u2019s courts to ensure that all contents that should be disclosed and \ndelivered to the public properly. In November 2018, the Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt promulgated opinions on further deepening judicial openness to \ncontinuously expand the breadth and depth of judicial openness.\nPromoting the openness of judicial process. In November 2014, the China \nJudicial Process Information Online was officially opened. Now, it has \nbecome a platform for centralized gathering and unified publishing of the \ninformation about the judicial process of the courts nationwide, providing \n\u201cone-stop\u201d disclosure service to the parties to the cases adjudicated by the \ncourts nationwide.

The items of the \npilot program includes, among other things, reforming the requirements for \nthe appointment of people\u2019s assessors, improving the mode of appointment \nof people\u2019s assessors, expanding the scope of participation in trials, defining \nthe powers to participate in trials, enhancing job security, establishing \nthe withdrawal mechanism, giving full play to the advantage of people\u2019s \nassessors in being familiar with the social situations and public opinions, \nand gradually realizing the goal that people\u2019s assessors no longer vote on \nissues relating to the application of law and only participate in the finding \nof facts. In order to further address the problems arising in the pilot reform, \nin April 2017, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress \ndecided to extend the pilot period by one year.

Promoting Scientific and Classified Management over \nJudicial Personnel\nAccording to the overall arrangement by the State and in cooperation with \nrelated departments of the Central Government, the Supreme People\u2019s Court \nhas fully reformed the judicial personnel management system. \nEstablishing a system for classified management of judicial personnel. \nIn response to the problem that the past judicial personnel management \nsystem did not fully reflect the characteristics of the judicial profession, \nthe Supreme People\u2019s Court has actively promoted the reform of the \nsystem for classified management of judicial personnel, by classifying the \njudicial personnel into judges, auxiliary judicial personnel and judicial \nadministrative personnel, and adopting different management systems for \ndifferent categories of personnel, to ensure that each of judges, auxiliary \njudicial personnel and judicial administrative personnel is assigned to a \ndefinite post of duty and attends to his own duties. As of the end of 2018, the \nproportion of judges, auxiliary judicial personnel and judicial administrative \npersonnel had reached 34.6%, 49.5% and 15.9% respectively.\nFully implementing the judge quota system. In line with the principle \nof determining quota based on cases, selecting personnel based on job \nrequirements, controlling total number, and making overall planning at \nthe provincial level, through well-designed examination and assessment \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   136\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n137\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nprocedures, the courts nationwide have selected a total of 125,000 judges \nfrom the former 210,000 judges. The newly-selected judges are mainly \nplaced on adjudicative posts rather than general administrative posts, \nand over 85% of judicial personnel resource are allocated to trial work, \noptimized the resource allocation and the team structure. All higher people\u2019s \ncourt have strictly honored the maximum quota and ratio determined by the \nCentral Government, and according to the number of cases handled, and \nthe situations of economic and social development, population and other \nbasic figures of the places where the courts are located, the level of trial and \nfunctions of the courts, workloads of judges, staffing of auxiliary judicial \npersonnel and other factors, have implemented a system of unified allocation \nof judge quota among the courts at three levels within one provincial \njurisdiction and providing priority to the primary people\u2019s courts and the \narea where the conflicts between caseload and personnel is serious. Mainly \non the amount of cases, Guangdong courts decided that the proportion of \njudges should be lower than 30% in Shantou where there are fewer cases \nbut exceed personnel, and be higher than 50% in Shenzhen, Dongguan, \nZhongshan and other cities where there are overloaded cases but relatively \nfewer staffs. A mechanism of  exchange and removal of judges has been \nestablished, and a mechanism of dynamic management of quota has been \ngradually formed, whereby one may be appointed or removal as judge and \nan appointed judge may be promoted or demoted. As of June 2018, 5,938 \njudges nationwide have been removed due to  post transfer, reassignment, \nresignation, retirement, and disqulification, or the like.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   137\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n138\n-\n-\nReforming the judge selection and appointment system. The courts at \nthe provincial level have established judge selection committees comprising \njudge representatives and relevant civilians, and formulated open, fair \nand just judge selection and appointment procedures, to ensure that only \noutstanding legal practitioners who are upright in character and have rich \nexperience and a high professional level will become judge candidates. In \norder to improve the system of selection of judges level by level, in May \n2016, the Organization Department of the CCCPC, the Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt and the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate jointly promulgated the \nopinions on establishing the system of selection of judges and public \nprosecutors level by level, which express provide that the judges of the \npeople\u2019s courts at the prefecture level or above shall be selected level by \nlevel generally. In October 2015, the Supreme People\u2019s Court, after strict \nselection procedures, selected 7 outstanding judges from 62 applicants \nfrom local courts nationwide. In March 2014, the Supreme People\u2019s Court \nconducted a program of publicly selecting high-level judicial talents from \nexperts, scholars, lawyers and other personnel practicing law, and finally \nselected five persons, including experts, scholars, senior lawyers and \noutstanding public prosecutors, from 195 applicants. In 2015, the courts in \nShanghai publicly selected one judge from outside the judicature, and the \ncourts in Qinghai publicly selected three judges from outside the judicature. \nThe courts in Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian and other regions have begun to \nselect judges from outstanding judge assistants and send them to serve in the \nprimary people\u2019s courts.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   138\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n139\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nReforming the rank of posts and compensation & benefit system \nof judges. A system of independent rank of posts of judges has been \nestablished so that: registered judges could be managed according to such \nindependent ranking order, judges\u2019 professional ranks are separated from \ntheir administrative ranks, and judges are promoted based on their seniority, \non a selective basis or specially; a personnel management system for \njudges that is different from that for other public servants and reflects the \nprofessional characteristics of judges has been implemented, which will \nbroaden the career development channels of grassroots judges and enhance \nthe professional honor and work enthusiasm of judges. As of the end of \n2018, all courts nationwide had established a mechanism for determining \nthe independent rank of posts of judges, about 98% courts had begun to \npromote judges along with their seniority, and about 52% courts had begun \nto promote judges on a selective basis. A compensation & benefit system \nhas been established, supporting the series of reforms of independent rank \nof posts of judges, and all courts nationwide have introduced the new salary \nsystem involving performance-based bonus, which greatly increased the \nsalary level of judges. By actively coordinating with  related departments \nof the Central Government, the Supreme People\u2019s Court has formulated \npolicies on post exchange, retirement age, medical benefit,, travel allowance, \ntraffic subsidy, and others benefits for judges, noticed those implementation \nof policies, and promoted the courts at all levels to effectively place these \npolicies.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   139\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n140\n-\n-\nReforming the system of recruiting and training auxiliary judicial \npersonnel. The Supreme People\u2019s Court, in cooperation with related \ndepartments of the Central Government, has issued opinion on recruiting \njudge assistants by people\u2019s courts. All regions have conducted unified \nindependent recruitment at provincial level in an orderly way, and steadily \nadvanced the position transfer of unadmitted judges and qualified clerks \nto judge assistant, to equip the courts with more judge assistants. In April \n2017, the Supreme People\u2019s Court, together with the Ministry of Finance \nand the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, launched a plan \nfor reforming the system on managing clerks, with a focus on the problems \nsolving that the management of contracted clerks was not standardized \nenough, the professional protection provided to contracted clerks is not \nstrong enough, and the team of contracted clerks is not stable enough. \nThe courts in all regions have expanded the sources of auxiliary judicial \npersonnel and explored the improvement of the system on managing and \ntraining auxiliary judicial personnel, with a focus on optimizing the structure \nof auxiliary judicial personnel. Since the reform, the number of auxiliary \njudicial personnel in Beijing courts has increased 68.8% from 2,689 to \n4,538; the ratio of number of judges to that of auxiliary judicial personnel \nin Shanghai courts has changed from 1:0.75 to 1:1.78. The Jiangsu Higher \nPeople\u2019s Court has vigorously pushed forward the reform of the clerk \nsystem, formulated the standards of the rank of posts of clerks and measures \nfor the training and evaluating clerks, properly defined the posts, the quantity \nand responsibilities of clerks, and provided that the proportion of first-line \njudges to clerks shall be 1:1.1, thereby changing the situation that  several \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   140\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n141\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\njudges assisted by one clerk in the past.\nEstablishing the legal research scholar and legal intern systems.

Most local courts have enhanced their cooperation with law \nschools and established a system of receiving  interns from law schools as \njudge assistants, who  participate in the auxiliary judicial work under the \nguidance of judges, alleviated the difficulty of understaffed judge assistants \nin the people\u2019s courts, and explored a new mode of classified management \nof judicial personnel. Chengdu Intermediate People\u2019s Court in Sichuan \nhas signed a cooperation agreement on  a mechanism of \u201c Judge Assistant \nInternship\u201d with 11 colleges and universities including Sichuan University, \nSouthwestern University of Finance and Economics and University of \nElectronic Science and Technology of China, by launching a program of \nintern judge assistants on campuses, whereby the colleges and universities \nin cooperation could select and send outstanding law graduates (or \nundergraduates) to participate in the auxiliary judicial work. So far, a total of \n304 interns of five phases have engaged in this program.\nStrengthening the professional ethics of the judiciary.

Junior judges are subject to \nprofessional qualification examination by provincial-level judge selection \ncommittees, and nomination, appointment and removal according to the \nlegal procedures by provincial-level governments in a centralized manner. \nThe provincial-level regions have also explored the reform of centralized \nfunding management system for local courts below provincial level in light \nof their respective local conditions. In 18 provinces, autonomous regions \nand municipalities directly governed by the Central Government such as \nBeijing, Tianjin and Shanxi and 2 cities specifically designated by the state \nplan namely Dalian and Shenzhen, the funds required by local courts below \nprovincial level are managed in a unified way by the provincial level, and \nall the courts at the provincial, municipal and county levels are classified as \nfirst-level budgetary units and prepare and submit their respective budgets \nto the provincial-level financial departments; their budgetary funds are \nappropriated from the central payment system of the Treasury.\nImproving the trial-level system. In order to adapt to the situations of \neconomic and social development, and reasonably defining the respective \nfunctions of the courts at four levels, the Supreme People\u2019s Court \nadjusted the thresholds for the jurisdiction of the higher people\u2019s courts \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   149\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:05\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n150\n-\n-\nand intermediate people\u2019s courts over civil and commercial cases of first \ninstance, and increased the threshold of the subject value of civil and \ncommercial cases of first instance under the jurisdiction of primary people\u2019s \ncourts; provided that major, difficult and complicated cases, new types of \ncases and typical cases in terms of application of law may be adjudicated \nby a people\u2019s court at a higher level as determined by it in its sole discretion \nor at the request of a people\u2019s court at a lower level. In February 2015, the \nSupreme People\u2019s Court promulgated the judicial interpretations on issues \nconcerning strict application of order for retrial and remand for retrial in the \nsupervisory procedure for the trial of civil cases, which unify the standard \nfor order for retrial and review of cases, strictly prohibit remand for retrial \nat will, and request that if a people\u2019s court at a higher level orders to retry a \ncase or remands a case for retrial, it shall elaborate in the ruling the detailed \nreasons for such order for retrial or remand for retrial.\nConducting pilot reform of trans-regional centralized jurisdiction over \nadministrative cases. Considering that an administrative case is subject \nto jurisdiction of the court in the place where the administrative organ \nas the defendant is located and may be subject to interference by local \nadministrative organs, according to the overall arrangement by the Central \nGovernment, the courts in all regions have been exploring the establishment \nof a system of jurisdiction over administrative cases relatively separate from \nadministrative divisions, through escalation of the jurisdiction to the higher \nlevel, cross-jurisdiction among different regions, relatively centralized \njurisdiction and otherwise, carrying out reforms of the jurisdiction system \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   150\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:05\n\n\n151\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nwith different characteristics, to practically solve serious problems in \nadministrative lawsuits, such as difficulty in case filing, difficulty in \ntrial and difficulty in enforcement.

The higher people\u2019s courts \nin Fujian, Shandong, Henan, Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan and other regions \nassigned the jurisdiction over certain administrative cases of first instance \nto some designated primary or intermediate people\u2019s courts other than the \ncourts originally having the jurisdiction over such cases, so as to eliminate \nthe public\u2019s concern about local protectionism, through fairly adjudicating \nall kinds of administrative cases as per law.\nImproving the system of specialized adjudication of and centralized \njurisdiction over environmental and resource cases. The courts at \nall levels have been exploring the mode of specialized adjudication of \ncivil, administrative and criminal environmental and resource cases. The \nEnvironmental and Resource Tribunals of the Supreme People\u2019s Court hear \nand adjudicate civil and administrative environmental and resource cases \nin a centralized manner. 16 higher people\u2019s courts such as those in Jiangsu \nand Fujian hear and adjudicate civil and administrative environmental \nand resource cases or civil, administrative and criminal environmental \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   151\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:05\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n152\n-\n-\nand resource cases in a centralized manner. The courts in all regions \nhave been exploring the mode of centralized jurisdiction over trans-\nregional environmental and resource cases, based on the characteristics \nof environmental and resources protection in each region. The higher \npeople\u2019s courts in Jiangsu, Henan, Hainan, Hubei and other regions have \nbeen exploring the centralized jurisdiction over environmental and resource \ncases within each of the ecosystems or ecological functional zones such \nas river basins and sea areas, and have been exploring the jurisdiction and \nadjudication mode more matching the characteristics of the ecological \nenvironment laws, to effectively prevent local protectionism and enhance \necological environmental protection.\nStrengthening the system requiring principals of administrative organs \nto appear in the court to respond to charges as per law. In July 2016, \nthe Supreme People\u2019s Court issued a notice requiring the people\u2019s courts \nin all regions to further regulate and promote response to administrative \nlawsuits pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Administrative Procedure \nLaw of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and providing that if the principal \nor related staff members of an administrative organ do not appear in the \ncourt personally and just appoint an attorney to appear in the court, or if the \nprincipal of an administrative organ fails to appear in the court at the written \nrequest of the people\u2019s court, the people\u2019s court shall record the fact in the \ncase file and state it in the judgment, and may issue public notices thereon \naccording to law, and suggest that the appointing authority, supervisory \nauthority or the administrative organ at the higher level should impose \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   152\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:05\n\n\n153\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nserious punishments on the responsible persons.

The open, and intelligent online Apps have been comprehensively \ndeveloped, and the main framework of court informatization version 3.0 has \nbeen established, which greatly promotes the modernization of the judicial \nsystem and judicial capability.\nEnhancing the formulation of top-level informatization planning \nand standards. The Supreme People\u2019s Court has issued the Five Year \nDevelopment Plan on Informatization of People\u2019s Courts 2016-2020, \nclarifying the key tasks and specific requirements for the construction of \nintelligent courts. In accordance with the guidelines of \u201csystematic projects, \nstandards first\u201d, the Supreme People\u2019s Court has improved the system of \nstandards for informatization of the people\u2019s courts, developed and released \n85 technical standards focus on the case data standards, to support the \ninformation resource sharing and exchange, R&D, information security and \nhigh quality and efficiency operation and maintenance system construction. \nIt has issued certain provisions on the Numbers of Cases Handled by \nPeople\u2019s courts and supplementary standards, the Case Information Standard \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   155\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:05\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n156\n-\n-\nfor People\u2019s courts (2015) and other normative documents to implement \ncode-based management of 3,500 courts nationwide, built a three-level case \ntypes system, thereby laying a solid foundation for building a new standard \nsystem for case information.\nStrengthening the construction of informatization infrastructure and \nsecurity system. The courts at all levels have been constantly upgrading \nand improving the court network systems to support online handling of all \njudicial matters, including specific court network, mobile network, specific \nexternal network, confidential intranets and Internet. Over 3,500 courts and \nover 10,000 detached tribunals across the country have connected with the \nspecific court network. Over 28,000 scientific and technological courtrooms \nhave been established nationwide to realize multimedia evidence discovery, \nremote trial, audio and video recording of court trials, and automated voice \nrecognition in process, and other functions. The Supreme People\u2019s Court \ntook the lead in proposing and establishing a high quality and efficiency \noperation and maintenance guarantee system, and building and using \nvisualized operation and maintenance management tools, which horizontally \ncover the five major network systems, vertically run through five layers, \nnamely infrastructure, judicial application, data management, information \nsecurity, and operation & maintenance.\nFully promoting electronic litigation. For further development in the \nInternet era, to promote the innovation of litigation mode and mechanism, \nthe courts at all levels have been vigorously promoting electronic litigation \nfor whole-process online. The Supreme People\u2019s Court has been instructing \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   156\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:05\n\n\n157\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nand promoting the courts nationwide to deploy five online standard modules \nfor case filing, payment, evidence exchange, hearing, and electronic \ndocuments service. The courts in Jilin, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu have fully \nestablished and widely used these modules. Zhejiang took the lead in \npiloting in Ningbo and promoting across the province \u201cMobile WeCourt\u201d, \nan one-step mobile litigation platform on WeChat small procedures, which \nenables the litigants handles more than 20 judicial matters online, such \nas case filing, inquiry, mediation, court trial, enforcement and payment. \nMobile WeCourt has reduced the average time consumption for the courts \nin Ningbo, Zhejiang to adjudicate first-instance civil and commercial cases \nby 17 days, the average time consumption to enforce by 28 days, and the \nfigures of litigants\u2019 complaints on \u201cjudges are often too busy to contact\u201d by \nnearly 30%.\nDeveloping and applying a criminal trial intelligent assistant system. \nAccording to the Central Government\u2019s plan for pushing forward the reform \nof the litigation system with a focus on trials, Shanghai has developed a \ncriminal trial intelligent assistant system with high-techs such as big data, \ncloud computing, and artificial intelligence to formulate uniformly evidence \nstandards applicable and evidence rules and embed them in the criminal \ncase handling system of public security organs, procuratorial organs, courts, \nand judicial administrative organs, so as to help staff on duty to collect and \nexamine evidence in a legal, comprehensive, and standardized manner, \nand ensure that the facts of cases found during investigations, prosecutions \nand trials are legitimate and that the whole process of handling criminal \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   157\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:05\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n158\n-\n-\ncases should be visualized, recorded and supervised, so as to reduce the \narbitrariness of the judiciary and effectively prevent the occurrence of \nunjust, falsely or wrongly charged or sentenced cases.\nStrengthening the intelligent assistance in case trial and judicial \nmanagement. In August 2016, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued \nguidelines on Comprehensively Promoting the Simultaneous Generation \nand In-depth Application of Electronic Case Files by People\u2019s courts, for \nthe purpose of promoting the electronic archiving of case files and the \nuploading to the case handling system, creating conditions for online case-\nhandling and the intelligent assistance in case trial for judges. Relying on \nthe big data management and service platform, the Supreme People\u2019s Court \nhas generated the information about cases files of courts nationwide, which \nlays the technical foundation for a court to access the electronic case files \nof another court. The Supreme People\u2019s Court has established the \u201cFaxin\u201d \nplatform to build a world-class legal information service, gather various \nacademic resources, cases, professional practices and improvements, and \nprovide comprehensive, convenient and intelligent service for searching and \ndelivering legal academic resource to different groups such as judges, legal \nprofessionals, scholars  and the public. All regions have developed a voice \nrecognition system for trials, which can automatically transform voice into \ntexts. Suzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court in Jiangsu has implemented the \nsystem to support over 27,000 court-hearings, with aaccuracy rate of voice \nrecognition above 90%, and with which  trial time shortened by 20%-30% \non average.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   158\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:05\n\n\n159\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nHaving informatization and big data serve judicial management and \ndecision making. The Supreme People\u2019s Court has built a big database \nto collect, manage, and analyze the judicial information from the courts \nnationwide and provide information services in need. This big database \ncollects the information about the case acceptance and closure by the courts \nnationwide in real time, automatically updates such information every 5 \nminutes, and collects information about 70,000 to 80,000 cases every day. \nIt is now the world\u2019s largest database of judicial information and supports \nthe analysis on the information about case acceptance and closure by the \ncourts nationwide and the distribution of cause of action of these cases. In \n2016, the courts nationwide fully realized the integration of judicial statistics \nwith the big data management and service platform, which indicates that \nthe people\u2019s courts have completely ended the history of manual justice \nstatistics. As needed by the quantitative personnel performance evaluation, \nthe big data management and service platform connects and integrates the \ncollected personnel data and case data, put forward the central method of \njudicial personnel management shifting from qualitative to quantitative.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   159\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:05\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n160\n-\n-\nConclusion\nThe new round of the reform of judicial system has been both problem-\noriented and goal-oriented, starting from the deep-seated problems affecting \njudicial impartiality and inhibiting judicial capability, and the problems \ninvolving the direct and realistic interests that the public care most; such \nreform has been observing all the time the laws of justice while proceeding \nfrom China\u2019s actual conditions, exploring the road of reform of the judicial \nsystem with Chinese characteristics, focusing on building and improving the \nsocialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics, and has been pushed \nforward step by step by operation of law, and combined top-down design \nwith exploration through pilot programs, so as to ensure that the reform will \nbe conducted in a vigorous and steady manner.\nThe people\u2019s understanding and support are the driving force behind the \njudicial reform, and the people\u2019s sense of gain is the standard for evaluating \nthe judicial reform.

When I tell people this today, they laugh and nod as if they understand, as if they too are part of a secret book-addict society whose greatest crime is staying up late, a flashlight under the covers, compulsively reading page after page. The strange thing is, no one ever asks me what my second addiction is. I mean, someone who loved to read could never be a real addict, could they? The kind of addict who steals from their family, betrays the people they love, commits felonies, implodes their life because the finding and using and finding more consumes every ounce of who they used to be. No one ever loses their job because they read too much. There are no book club interventions. The prisons aren\\u2019t full of people who stole to fund their Kindle habit. The truth is I\\u2019ve only ever had one addiction. The white whale of addictions: escape. From as far back as I can remember there has always been a better place than wherever I am. A better me than whoever I was. Books helped me escape when I was young. Not just because of my precocious angsty-ness and early onset existential crises; they were literal escape. Most of my early childhood memories are just stories told to me decades later. Stories of violence and starvation and abandonment. I do remember every teacher, though, from kindergarten through high school. I remember the first multisyllabic word I read in school: policeman. I was so proud of myself as I sounded out the letters. In first grade I read Gone with the Wind\\u2014twice. It was over a thousand pages. I didn\\u2019t understand Rhett Butler or Scarlett O\\u2019Hara or the Civil War, but I savored the endless tiny print pages of word after word. I savored the escape. The longer the book the better. The only clear memories I have besides school after the age of ten are of moments of crisis. My brothers stealing my stepfather\\u2019s Pinto and sinking it in Walden Pond. The police bringing my sister home for public drunkenness. My aunt Janice arriving from San Francisco in the middle of the night, her face swollen and unrecognizable\\u2014a mix of red, black, and blue. My brothers and sister dancing around my stepfather\\u2019s finger that they found on the front lawn after my mom rushed him bleeding to the hospital. It was a lawn mower accident of some sort, and it was the only time I remember my siblings expressing joy. I didn\\u2019t know why they hated my stepfather so much, or what made him pack up one day and leave for good. I don\\u2019t have a single memory of eating dinner at home with my family. I don\\u2019t recall any vacations. If I try to remember my childhood, there is only a vague sense of fear, of unease. I have no clear picture of anything concrete or symbolic representing home, and with two of my siblings dying young, I don\\u2019t have anyone left to fill in the blanks. I only see myself alone in my room, reading. And not in a meet-cute, flashlight-under-the-covers, love-affair-with-books kind of way. When I talk about my childhood book addiction, I\\u2019m talking about a desperate grip on the pages, reading the same books over and over, never having enough pages to fill the void. When I read, I could pretend I was someone else. I was Harriet the Spy, Nancy Drew, Lucy in Narnia. I was Scarlett O\\u2019Hara declaring she would never go hungry again. I was a teenager visiting California for the first time, meeting the boy of her dreams, and fighting all night to keep the distant family\\u2019s orange grove from freezing in a cold spell. I was a feisty woman who didn\\u2019t need a man until she desperately needed him in every Nora Roberts book ever written. Because we moved from Maynard to Concord, I also read Alcott, Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Emerson. I read Tolstoy and Dostoevsky but found Russian relationships to be far more confusing than the ones in Nora Roberts\\u2019s worlds. I loved happy endings, characters who had clear motivations for doing what they did. I read books like a peeping Tom, and I stalked all these lives that weren\\u2019t mine. Even the sad people in books had moments of joy and redemption that I envied. Eventually the reading turned to writing. I started writing short stories in high school and they got me the attention I hungered for. I always loved school. I played varsity lacrosse and field hockey. I could be friends with the cool kids and the smart kids and the sporty kids and even the stoner kids although I didn\\u2019t like to get stoned. I could cross social lines seamlessly and be whoever people needed me to be. I\\u2019d like to say it was a gift born of my curiosity about people, but in truth it was more of a response to trauma. I wanted to be loved. I wanted to feel safe. So I needed every single person I met to like me, and if I could make them love and need me, even better. After school I went home with different friends and did homework at their kitchen table and joined their family for dinner. At each home I could pretend I was exactly who they thought I must be. Everyone\\u2019s parents loved me, except my own. I was the first person in my family to get into college. I took out loans and put myself through undergrad and graduate school three thousand miles away. I reinvented myself in California. I moved into the dorms at UC Santa Cruz and wore tie-dye shirts and played Ultimate Frisbee. I hung tapestries in my dorm room and slept with my resident adviser. Then I slept with his best friend. No one could believe, with my long beach-blond hair and my flowing hippie scarves, that I grew up in Massachusetts. The first week of college I tried mushrooms, and cocaine, and LSD. They were passed around like candy during orientation week. Who I was before college was quickly tucked away on a shelf. That Lara was over, and I was officially a carefree peace-and-love California surfer girl. I majored in creative writing, because that meant I could keep reading, keep writing, and keep escaping. I thought I could outrun whatever afflicted my family, and I swore I would never be like any of them. I thought education equaled inoculation, and if I just kept being the good girl with the good grades who said the right things and played the right parts, my life would not end in Anna Karenina tragedy. But you can\\u2019t outrun yourself, and eventually books and writing didn\\u2019t give me the escape I still craved. I turned to sex, and food, and money when I had it, and more sex when I didn\\u2019t. And then it was opiates; Vicodin for a long, semi-manageable time, and then heroin. I was addicted to all those things and none of those things. Escape was always my real addiction, the one true high. Books were just my gateway drug. Sex just got me pregnant. Food just made me puffy. Vicodin just helped me pretend I was happy. The heroin, though, that gave me everything I had ever wanted\\u2014peace, joy, escape. Until it didn\\u2019t. And everything I knew and everyone I loved was gone. \\n chapter 2 STAYCATION The key to committing a crime is the same as it is for doing anything you\\u2019re unsure of\\u2014confidence. With my head held high and a straight fake-it-till-you-make-it attitude, I walk into the Seaside Inn Resort and Spa like I belong there. I haven\\u2019t showered in three days and my hair is in an unkempt topknot, but I put on my sunglasses and do my best impression of Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada as I saunter through the revolving door. I stumble a little because I haven\\u2019t eaten much in the last three days, and the revolutions give me vertigo. Kaden\\u2019s chubby toddler hand is held tightly in mine, and he\\u2019s wearing his favorite Spider-Man onesie. Our dog, Chase, is in the back seat of the car waiting with the valet. I don\\u2019t have any money to tip the valet when we leave, but I\\u2019ll worry about that later. \\u201cAren\\u2019t you excited for a little vacation?\\u201d I say to Kaden. \\u201cYour brothers love the Seaside Inn, and they are going to meet up with us after school.\\u201d Kaden does a little Spider-Man wiggle and holds my hand tighter. \\u201cThey even have a hot tub,\\u201d I say a little too loudly. I\\u2019m desperately trying to pass as nonchalant. The power is turned off at our house so we can\\u2019t stay home with no heat and no electricity. Plus, my next-door neighbors saw me greet the mailman and take their mail along with my own, which I played off as a mistake and handed to them when they ran out of their house. But I know they know. I\\u2019ll worry about that later. I spent the morning on my computer buying online Best Western gift cards with a credit card I had stolen from an unlocked car at back-to-school night two days ago. Then I prepaid this hotel using the gift cards. I have to show ID to check in, but I\\u2019m hoping the gift cards aren\\u2019t connected to the stolen credit card. The woman had a ton of credit cards in her purse, so fingers crossed she hasn\\u2019t noticed one missing. I only took the one card, which is safely in the pocket of my sweatpants, so I feel inordinately virtuous. I did use it to buy gas and lunch for Kaden, plus some snacks for the boys when they get here, but I kept my head down in case there were cameras at the store. \\u201cChecking in?\\u201d the clerk asks. \\u201cYes,\\u201d I say. \\u201cLast name?\\u201d I hesitate for just a second too long, and he tilts his head to the right slightly. He can\\u2019t be over twenty-five, and he peers at me expectantly from behind wire-rimmed glasses. I can tell he\\u2019s wearing them to look older, to look professional. I know that game, and I smile brightly at him and take a deep breath. \\u201cLove,\\u201d I say, \\u201cLara Love.\\u201d \\u201cIf I could just see your ID, please.\\u201d I let go of Kaden\\u2019s hand and reach into my pocket to pull out my driver\\u2019s license. I leave the credit card with another mom\\u2019s name on it in my pocket. He takes my license and then starts tapping away on his computer. I pick Kaden up in my arms and rest him against the marble counter. The tapping continues, marked with occasional pauses while he squints at his screen. The squinting confirms to me that the glasses are just for show, and for some reason this makes me feel better. \\u201cThere are giant goldfish in the koi pond here,\\u201d I say to Kaden. The clerk smiles at me, and I smile back. \\u201cI got married here,\\u201d I explain to him. \\u201cA long time ago\\u2014twelve years ago actually. My first husband.\\u201d He nods and continues tapping. I have to stop myself from saying more. I can\\u2019t act like I\\u2019m nervous. That\\u2019s the first thing that will give you away. \\u201cBoy, has it changed around here.\\u201d I need to shut up, but if we can\\u2019t stay here I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019ll go. I\\u2019m dodging the repo men who are coming for my car, dodging a neighbor who knows I took a check from him and used it at the grocery store. I can\\u2019t take Kaden home when we have no food and no electricity. If only we can get in our room, then I can take a breath and figure out what to do next. Then it will be just like we\\u2019re on vacation. The clerk finally stops tapping. \\u201cIt looks like you\\u2019re all prepaid for the room for a week. I\\u2019ll just need the plate number for your parking pass and a credit card for incidentals.\\u201d My grip on Kaden tightens. Shit, shit, shit. I completely forgot that part of resort check-in. I have to think on my feet. I don\\u2019t have a working credit card. \\u201cWill you charge the card?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cMy sister\\u2019s joining me here and I left my purse in her car. I happen to have her card, though. Long story. But I don\\u2019t want to charge anything to her. This trip is my treat, so can I switch the card later?\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019ll just authorize the card, but you can use a different card if there\\u2019s a balance when you check out.\\u201d \\u201cWhat sister?\\u201d asks Kaden. I smile at him but ignore the question. My sister died twenty years ago, but I can\\u2019t think about that right now. I just need to get us to our room. I pull out the card and hand it to the clerk. He swipes it without even looking at the name, and I realize I\\u2019ve made up the sister lie for no reason. \\u201cThere\\u2019s not a lot of people here right now; we\\u2019re before the holiday rush, so I\\u2019ve upgraded you.\\u201d I don\\u2019t register what holiday he\\u2019s talking about, but then I remember it was just Halloween so he must be talking about Thanksgiving. \\u201cThanks so much, that\\u2019s very kind. My sister will love it here. She\\u2019s visiting from the East Coast.\\u201d I really need to stop talking. \\u201cAnd we\\u2019re a polling place, so in a couple of days there will be a lot of activity in our main ballroom for the presidential election, but your room is far away.\\u201d \\u201cOh great, I love to vote.\\u201d He just blinks at me a few times too many and says nothing. \\u201cWe love Obama,\\u201d I add unnecessarily, looking down at Kaden for acknowledgment. Kaden has no comment on the election, and after an awkward pause, the clerk hands me a set of key cards in a little envelope. \\u201cTwo keys enough?\\u201d I nod and watch as he writes the room number on the outside. He pulls out a little map of the resort. \\u201cYou\\u2019re here,\\u201d he says, and marks the lobby with an X. \\u201cIf you drive around to the right side here, you can park right behind your suite. Room service is until ten p.m., and the hot tub is really close for Spider-Man. And the koi are here.\\u201d I study the line he\\u2019s drawn with an arrow to our room as if it\\u2019s an algebra problem I\\u2019m going to be tested on. \\u201cWonderful, and thanks so much for the upgrade.\\u201d \\u201cReady, buddy?\\u201d I ask Kaden. \\u201cI want a baby sister,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI think three older brothers is enough,\\u201d I say with a laugh. I roll my eyes at the clerk before we turn to walk out, but then remember I\\u2019m still wearing my sunglasses. I really need to get it together. My car is still out front, and the valet looks at me expectantly. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have any cash on me,\\u201d I say, \\u201cbut I\\u2019ll catch you before we go out to dinner.\\u201d \\u201cNo problem,\\u201d he says. Only it is a problem, one of many big problems. We park and walk into the hotel through an open courtyard. Our suite is located on the ground floor and is decorated with seashell lamps and large abstract paintings that I think are supposed to look like ocean waves. Despite its name, the Seaside Inn is a good twenty-minute walk to the nearby state beach, with Highway 1 running between the hotel and the shore. The suite is large, and there\\u2019s a bedroom with two beds and a large living room with a beige foldout couch. There\\u2019s also a sliding door that opens to the back where I\\u2019ve parked, which makes it easier to sneak in the dog and unload our bags, toys, snacks, and dog food. Once everything is inside, I hang the DO NOT DISTURB sign, double-lock the door, and pull the curtain closed in front of the slider. Only then do I lie down on the bed and take a deep breath. I still have to figure out the credit card situation and tip the valet, but for now we are here. We are safe. And I can pretend everything happening outside of this room is far, far away from me. Not long ago, I could vacation at a resort like this for real, with my own credit card and ID and plenty of cash to tip everyone. In the past year, my life has collapsed. I turn on PBS for Kaden and give him a Fruit Roll-Up, and as Sesame Street plays I grab my purse, walk into the bathroom, and lock the door. I carefully unfold the tarnished piece of foil and study its surface. It\\u2019s marred with black scorch marks and tiny remnants of black tar heroin. There\\u2019s nothing here really, but it\\u2019s worth a shot. I grab a lighter and a straw, and I hold the flame under the bottom of the foil and pray that something on the surface bubbles into smoke. I just need a little bit to get me through until my husband, DJ, gets here with more. I had told him I would handle the hotel if he handled the drugs. \\u201cGo provide,\\u201d I had joked, \\u201cwhile I get shelter.\\u201d But now, sitting in this bathroom, my joke doesn\\u2019t feel that funny. And the tinfoil yields nothing but parched soot. I open the door to check on Kaden. \\u201cYou okay, baby guy?\\u201d He smiles at me, his baby teeth covered in red Fruit Roll-Up, and points at Big Bird. \\u201cI know,\\u201d I say, \\u201cI love him too! I\\u2019ll be out in a sec, okay?\\u201d He turns back to the television, and I close the bathroom door and sit on the marble floor. I dump my entire purse out and carefully move all the items\\u2014hairbrush, which I haven\\u2019t used in a while, wallet, empty pill bottle, grocery store receipt\\u2014to the side in their own pile. Then I carefully pick through the dust and bottom-of-purse debris until I find some small brown chips. I carefully use the pad of my index finger to blot them up and then gently scrape them onto the foil. I do this over and over until every last crumb rests on the foil. This time, when I put the flame under the foil, the top slightly boils and smoke rises. I quickly inhale it through the straw and hold my breath as long as possible. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m smoking heroin or food crumbs or lint, but I feel the anxiety slowly leave my chest. Anxiety for me has always felt like being in trouble, and with one big exhale, for a few brief shiny-foil moments, I feel all my troubles float away. No villain ever thinks of herself as a villain, and certainly in the story I told about my life, I was always the good guy. Everything I did, I told myself, was for my children. In my mind, my crimes had no victims, or if they did, the victims were corporate entities so vast they were as formless as air. I couldn\\u2019t think about the woman whose card I had used to check into the Seaside Inn, because I knew her. She was a crunchy, granola-type mom with five children all in a Montessori school. We weren\\u2019t close, except in the way mom friends are who only say hi to each other at school events or birthday parties or commiserating in the pickup line after school. I didn\\u2019t know her story, or what she did for a living besides being a mom, or what she feared or what her struggles were. In my mind, she had to be someone well off, oblivious to suffering, untouched by heartache or struggle. Just another perfect mom living a perfect life, parenting perfectly in her perfect house with her perfect partner. She probably did Pilates, made her own yogurt, and had deep, meaningful conversations with her close circle of friends. I didn\\u2019t hate her; I just wished I could be her. DJ doesn\\u2019t get to the hotel until almost nine. Kaden is asleep in the bedroom when he comes in. \\u201cNice place,\\u201d he says. \\u201cDid you get it?\\u201d \\u201cWho takes care of you?\\u201d he asks. \\u201cYou?\\u201d I say weakly. \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. I sold some stuff from the house and hooked us up.\\u201d His pupils are tiny pinpricks, so I know he used before he came here. I feel jealous, and I\\u2019m anxious for the small talk to stop so I can get to it. I don\\u2019t ask what he sold because I don\\u2019t want to know. I just hope it wasn\\u2019t anything that belonged to our children. I have three boys from my first marriage, he has a boy and a girl from his first marriage, and together we share Kaden Love Jackson\\u2014the second-marriage baby glue that holds us all together. We are a blended family, sharing custody and coparenting with our exes: we don\\u2019t believe in saying \\u201cstep\\u201d children or \\u201chalf\\u201d siblings. Six children ages three to seventeen who depend on me. I don\\u2019t tell DJ about the stolen credit card, because he\\u2019s just set down a golf-ball-size lump of black tar heroin. \\u201cWow,\\u201d I say. \\u201cDid you sell your car?\\u201d He shakes his head and pulls out a fresh sheet of tinfoil. He breaks off a small piece of heroin and hands it to me along with a strip of foil. I get up quickly to check that Kaden is still sleeping in the other room and then softly close the door between the bedroom and the living room. \\u201cDid the boys come after school?\\u201d DJ asks. \\u201cNo. Cody had basketball and Dylan was with friends and Ty said he had a lot of homework.\\u201d \\u201cSo Bryan and Darcy wouldn\\u2019t let them?\\u201d \\u201cNo, they just had teenage things to do. It\\u2019s a school night for them.\\u201d I know I sound defensive, but it\\u2019s easier for me to believe my boys are busy than face the truth: I\\u2019m chaos right now, and they have chosen to stay at their dad\\u2019s. \\u201cI mean, it\\u2019s the same with Hailey and Logan.\\u201d DJ blows smoke in my face. \\u201cIt\\u2019s her week with them, but the boys were going to spend time with you.\\u201d I can\\u2019t believe we are going to have a coparenting fight right now. I haven\\u2019t told DJ that Bryan informed me he is keeping the boys for the foreseeable future because they told him I wasn\\u2019t getting them to school on time, or picking them up on time, and that I was making dinner really late at night, if I made it at all. \\u201cHandle your business,\\u201d is all he said to me, which is Bryan-speak for \\u201cGet your shit together, because I know something is wrong but I don\\u2019t really want to know what.\\u201d I never would have told Bryan anyway, but it would have been nice to have been asked if I was okay. I\\u2019m suddenly so angry at DJ I want to throw something at him, but I don\\u2019t want to wake Kaden. \\u201cYou know,\\u201d I say, \\u201cthis hotel is where Bryan and I had our wedding.\\u201d It\\u2019s not a lamp to the face, but it will still cut him. \\u201cGreat. Did you have your honeymoon night in this room?\\u201d \\u201cMaybe.\\u201d In truth, our wedding night was spent in a top-floor suite on the other side of the hotel. Our friends had covered the bed in rose petals, but we were so tired we\\u2019d just brushed them off and gone to sleep. Dylan was a year old, and I was pregnant with Cody at the time, so I wasn\\u2019t up for a wild night unless it involved a foot massage and more wedding cake. But those are the last things I would tell my current husband right now. After we smoke, DJ immediately nods off on the couch and begins to snore. I check the locks on the doors and peer out the back window to make sure the car is still there. Opiates never make me sleepy. They give me a boost of energy and life. They make me feel capable and normal. The credit card is still in my pocket, so I pull it out and read the name: Carol Clark. For some reason the alliteration makes me weepy, and I send a silent apology to Carol wherever she is. Then I call Bryan. \\u201cHey,\\u201d I say. \\u201cSorry to call so late.\\u201d \\u201cNo problem,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re having a little staycation at the Seaside Inn. Just a break before the holiday madness, you know?\\u201d Bryan says nothing. \\u201cCould the boys come by after school tomorrow for swimming and dinner? The pool is heated and there\\u2019s a hot tub. I\\u2019ll bring them back to your house right after dinner.\\u201d Still more silence. \\u201cPlease, I really miss them. I know things have been a bit crazy, but all is good now, really.\\u201d \\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d \\u201cI promise. Everything with me is back to normal.\\u201d I stare down at the half-melted lump on the tinfoil. When we were married, I had told Bryan I had a problem with Vicodin. I took three pills every day this week and they make me so happy, I had said. I think I have a problem. I might need help. Please throw them away for me. I can\\u2019t do it. He had just shrugged and put them on the top shelf of the linen closet. \\u201cIt\\u2019s no big deal, everyone takes them.\\u201d Later that week, after watching out the window all night waiting for him to come home, I had dragged a chair over to the closet and retrieved the bottle. Five years later we were long divorced, and my three pills a day had become sixty. I look over at DJ snoring and say the thing on my mind to Bryan. \\u201cIt\\u2019s no big deal, everyone goes through a hard time now and then.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t get the reference. I wake up to the hotel phone ringing loudly. Its tone is shrill and jarring. DJ is not in the bed next to the one Kaden and I are sleeping in, and I fumble with the receiver when I answer. \\u201cHello?\\u201d My voice comes out dry and croaking. I\\u2019m dehydrated and my head hurts. \\u201cMs. Love?\\u201d \\u201cYes?\\u201d \\u201cThere is a problem with your credit card that we need to speak to you about.\\u201d The woman\\u2019s voice is too sharp for my brain. \\u201cIt\\u2019s my sister\\u2019s card.\\u201d \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s been reported stolen, so we need to speak to your sister.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s asleep right now.\\u201d \\u201cWell, we need you both to come to the front desk immediately.\\u201d I look around the room frantically. \\u201cOkay, just give us a few minutes and I\\u2019m sure we can sort this out. There\\u2019s obviously been an error with the bank. I\\u2019ll give you another card, and my sister can call the bank with you.\\u201d Her tone softens. \\u201cWell, okay, that would be great. I\\u2019ll be here, and I\\u2019ll see you in a few.\\u201d \\u201cFifteen minutes tops,\\u201d I say. \\u201cMy baby is sleeping so I need to get him up.\\u201d \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m so sorry, of course\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, it\\u2019s not your fault. We\\u2019ll be there as soon as possible. We\\u2019re supposed to be on a staycation.\\u201d I laugh softly and hang up. I run into the living room, but DJ isn\\u2019t there either, and when I look out the back window his car is gone. I try his cell but he doesn\\u2019t answer. Now what? I go into the bathroom and splash water on my face. My eyes are red-rimmed and my face is pale. I quickly pinch my cheeks to give them color and hurriedly throw my sweats and T-shirt on. I open the slider and let the dog out to pee and then put him in the back of my SUV. I roll down the front passenger window and run back into the suite grabbing everything I can carry and then run back out to toss it through the window. I do this several times, just loosely piling up toys and food and Kaden\\u2019s books and our clothing on the floor and the passenger seat. I toss our empty tote bags on top of the pile then run back inside. DJ must have taken all the heroin because I can\\u2019t find anything but the used foil and my lighter and straw. I throw them in my purse and strap it across my body. Kaden is still sleeping, both arms stretched above his head and his cheeks rosy pink. I gently lift him from the bed and carry him to his car seat. He wakes up when I strap him in. \\u201cHot tub now?\\u201d he asks. \\u201cFish?\\u201d \\u201cSoon, baby,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to go play at the park first.\\u201d I close the back door and get in the driver\\u2019s seat. I don\\u2019t have time to worry if DJ will come back before I get ahold of him. I throw the car in reverse and peel out of the lot. As I\\u2019m driving back toward the lobby I see a serious-looking man and woman in black suits walking toward my room. They look like security, and their heads whip around to watch as I speed past. \\u201cNo park, I want to see the fish.\\u201d Kaden starts to cry in his car seat, and I know a full-blown three-year-old tantrum is brewing. \\u201cFish!\\u201d he screams and begins to kick his feet against the back of the passenger seat. I turn onto the highway but don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going. Kaden is crying harder, and I want to cry with him. We\\u2019re both tired and hungry and want comfort. I get off the freeway at the exit to our house but instead of going home I drive to Willowbrook Park. It\\u2019s Kaden\\u2019s favorite, and I\\u2019m hoping a turn on the swings will distract him. I need to take him to see some fish. I need to find DJ. I need to call Bryan and tell him there\\u2019s been a change of plans. I need so many things I can\\u2019t think straight, but mostly I need to smoke some heroin because I\\u2019m already starting to feel a bit nauseous and uncomfortable. Every mom from our neighborhood goes to Willowbrook with their children, and I definitely don\\u2019t want to see anyone I know. Not looking like this. Not feeling like this. I pull up next to the park but don\\u2019t turn off the car. Kaden is suddenly quiet, distracted by all the kids playing. I startle when my cell rings, but quickly see it\\u2019s DJ. \\u201cWhere are you?\\u201d I say instead of hello. \\u201cI went to get some stuff from the house.\\u201d \\u201cIs the power still off?\\u201d \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s not going to magically turn itself on.\\u201d \\u201cI had to leave the hotel,\\u201d I whisper into the phone. \\u201cWe\\u2019re at Willowbrook. They found out the card was stolen. I ran out the back. And I need to\\u2026 you know\\u2026 you took the stuff.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, sorry. I\\u2019m just around the corner, I\\u2019ll be right there.\\u201d My whispering has caught Kaden\\u2019s attention, so I smile at him in the rearview mirror. \\u201cWant to go on the swings?\\u201d I ask brightly. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll have a picnic.\\u201d All I have is chips and Fruit Roll-Ups and juice boxes, but that will have to be enough. I try to push all the clothes and toys down onto the floor so if anyone I know walks by they won\\u2019t think I\\u2019m messy and homeless. I\\u2019m so messy and homeless. DJ\\u2019s truck rolls up in a couple of minutes, and he is lit up and happy. He swings Kaden out of his car seat while surreptitiously handing me the ball of heroin. \\u201cHandle your business while we play,\\u201d he says. What is it with men telling me to handle my business? I get in the back seat and hang towels in the windows so I can\\u2019t be seen while I smoke. The dog starts to whine so I know he needs to be walked. I have to make a plan but can\\u2019t until I get my mind right. I need to get the power on at home. I need to call Bryan so that he doesn\\u2019t bring the boys to the hotel later. I need everything to go back to the way it was a year ago. I was clean and sober and running a successful business, and I wasn\\u2019t stealing and lying and running from hotel security. After my fifth inhale, I decide I\\u2019m going to report my purse stolen\\u2014that will explain my ID being used with a stolen credit card. This idea feels ingenious, and as soon as I have a plan I relax. I will also call PG&E and pretend I\\u2019ve just moved into our house as a renter and need to set up new service. They won\\u2019t bill me for a month. I can\\u2019t believe I haven\\u2019t thought of this before. High on the heroin, I pull the towel down and look outside\\u2014it\\u2019s beautiful. The grass is green and the sky is blue and children are laughing and playing. I\\u2019ll tell Bryan that he can drop the boys at the house after school. I know I\\u2019ll need some groceries before they get there, but as I see all the blankets spread on the green, green grass and all the diaper bags and backpacks and purses lying unattended on those blankets while parents chase their toddlers around the park, I know I can get grocery money easily. In this moment, anything and everything feels possible. I don\\u2019t want to stay at a hotel, I want to go home. My home with Kaden\\u2019s giant playroom, where my boys have their bedrooms with matching bedroom sets, and the dog has room to run, and my king-size bed is comfortable and warm. Kaden and I will bake cookies and start getting ready for Thanksgiving by making construction paper turkeys after tracing his beautiful little hand on the thick brown paper and cutting carefully around the lines. I\\u2019ll pull out the glue sticks and stickers that he loves, and we\\u2019ll watch his favorite Disney movie, Mulan, and I\\u2019ll make popcorn with butter and salt, and we\\u2019ll both take baths and come out clean. It will be cozy and soft and all the good things. My boys will come home, and I will talk about college applications with Dylan, and basketball with Cody, and Ty will tell me about the latest books he\\u2019s reading and all about the magical worlds where the stories take place. In this moment I know everything is going to be okay, it\\u2019s all going to work out. I will fix all the things I have broken. I just need to go home. \\n chapter 3 CUL-DE-SACS AND SQUAD CARS Hide the drugs!\\u201d DJ thrusts a piece of tinfoil and a small baggie made of Saran Wrap filled with white powder into my hand and runs out of our bedroom. I\\u2019m still trying to register what sounds like a million fists pounding on the front door. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s cocaine or meth in the wrap. I have never asked. I look around our bedroom, which lacks a secret hidey-hole to stash drugs when the police come. This isn\\u2019t a crack house or a drug den; it\\u2019s an overpriced two-story home on a cul-de-sac in Aptos, California. I look around our room, the tinfoil held awkwardly in my hand like a butler holding out a silver tray. I hear loud voices downstairs. Kaden is down there. Now that the power is back on, I had just gotten him settled in the living room in front of the big screen to watch his favorite show, Wonder Pets! We lined up all his stuffed animals around him in a circle. We sing the theme song all day every day\\u2014it\\u2019s about teamwork and saving a baby penguin that\\u2019s in trouble. It\\u2019s sappy but not as bad as the purple dinosaur song that was the soundtrack when my three older boys were toddlers. I could use the Wonder Pets right now because I\\u2019m in trouble. I\\u2019m not surprised the police are here, but I\\u2019m also not prepared. I pull open DJ\\u2019s sock drawer and throw the tinfoil in the back. In our bathroom, I pull out the top drawer of the vanity and throw the small baggie in the back, behind the toothpaste and eye drops and dental floss. These drugs have lived in our home for almost a year, and like bad houseguests, they have taken over everything. I should have evicted them. Instead I welcomed them, and now it\\u2019s too late. DJ calls my name from downstairs. I walk out of my room and down the hall. To the left is Kaden\\u2019s room\\u2014my sweet baby with the pudgy cheeks and the white-blond curls who loves stickers and dogs and who can only fall asleep at night if I lightly run my fingernails up and down his arm. Straight ahead is the room Ty and Cody share. To the right is the room my stepchildren, Hailey and Logan, share. Dylan\\u2019s room is downstairs. We are a confusing group at back-to-school nights and sporting events. My ex-husband and his wife. My current husband\\u2019s ex-wife and her partner. My current husband and me. Kaden is the only constant, the child who doesn\\u2019t share time at another house. We like to think we are progressive parents who put the needs of our children over our own needs and wants. But that\\u2019s a hard truth to justify considering I\\u2019ve just hidden illegal drugs in my bedroom. Considering I\\u2019ve failed them all. I have tried to be the mom I never had. I\\u2019ve tried to show up. Let them know they are loved. I have the house and the SUV. I volunteer in the classroom and only occasionally argue with refs at junior high basketball games. I\\u2019ve tried so hard to play the part of the perfect mother. But trying to be the perfect mother makes it really hard to admit when you have a problem. Perfect mothers don\\u2019t do drugs. And perfect mothers don\\u2019t get arrested. I pause at the top of the stairs and look down. Two sheriff\\u2019s deputies in uniform are staring up at me. Like Scarlett O\\u2019Hara at her first ball, I descend the stairs slowly. Only I am no debutante and neither of these men are Rhett Butler. I see the past year in a flash, and I realize that every single choice has led to this moment. I can\\u2019t pretend I didn\\u2019t know it was coming. I used to imagine what I would do if they came for me. I\\u2019d put a ladder out my back window that I could climb down, Kaden in my arms, and escape into the woods behind our yard. I never put the ladder up, though. Maybe I didn\\u2019t want to escape. Or maybe I just knew I had no one and nowhere to run to. I still had enough self-awareness to know that this person I had become was not me. I didn\\u2019t hurt people. I didn\\u2019t steal. I didn\\u2019t lie. I didn\\u2019t push away friends and family. I didn\\u2019t cheat on my husband. I didn\\u2019t neglect my children. I didn\\u2019t do hard drugs. I didn\\u2019t commit crimes. Only I did. I do. And I am so tired. I don\\u2019t eat. I rarely drink water. I have been living on Reese\\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, Coca-Cola, and heroin smoke. My clothes are hanging off me. I finally found the perfect diet to lose the extra baby weight, but an unfortunate side effect of the addiction diet is there\\u2019s no one left in your life to admire your new physique. Plus, it turns your skin gray. From the neck down I look fantastic, but my face looks like I\\u2019m pushing eighty instead of forty. A few months ago, when a worried friend asked me how I had lost so much weight, I said I\\u2019d read The Secret and was visualizing myself skinny. I thought it was genius at the time, but that\\u2019s another symptom of addiction\\u2014thinking you\\u2019re smarter than you really are. I promised her I was okay, and I thought she believed me. I have been pretending I\\u2019m okay for so long that I don\\u2019t even know what okay means. I go to sleep every night swearing I will fix everything tomorrow. I will end this marriage. I will get clean. I will stop trying to hustle through the day like the perfect cul-de-sac housewife I thought I wanted to be. Tomorrow I would face the fact that all our money was gone, school fees were unpaid, the mortgage was behind, the car was about to get repossessed, my business was in shambles. But yesterday I had to steal to buy groceries, gas, and the drugs that would get me through today so I could fix everything tomorrow. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. As I take each tentative step down those stairs\\u2014see the handcuffs the deputy has out for me, hear the Wonder Pets! theme song playing louder and louder\\u2014I know I\\u2019ve run out of tomorrows. And part of me is relieved. But then I lock eyes with Kaden, who has looked away from his show, from his stuffed animal family, and I can see his worry. He knows this is not normal. \\u201cTurn around,\\u201d says one of the sheriff\\u2019s deputies, yanking an arm and spinning me so it\\u2019s behind my back. Kaden stands up at the loud voice. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d I say as the handcuffs snap on. \\u201cWatch your show. I promise it\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d My voice cracks when I tell this lie. I give him a big fake smile. The deputy starts to push me toward our family room. I see Kaden\\u2019s lip quivering. \\u201cPlease,\\u201d I beg, \\u201cplease just watch your show.\\u201d He takes a step toward me. \\u201cNo,\\u201d I yell, harsher than I mean to. The Wonder Pets start singing again, and he sits back down. The other deputy goes upstairs, and DJ follows me to the family room. They have not handcuffed him. We sit next to each other on the couch. I watch him surreptitiously pull a tiny baggie out of his pocket and tuck it in the back of the couch. He\\u2019s stuffed drugs down with the loose change, pencils, bouncy balls, and all the other couch detritus of suburban life. The deputy asks us, \\u201cWhat is my partner going to find upstairs?\\u201d I think about the drugs I have just poorly hidden. I also think about the neighbors\\u2019 mail and credit cards that I\\u2019ve stuffed in a drawer in my closet. I don\\u2019t answer, and neither does DJ, because we have watched every episode of Law & Order. I just stare at the back wall of the family room. It\\u2019s a dark blue accent wall. When we moved into this house, with down payment help from my mother-in-law, I let the kids choose what color they wanted for each of their rooms. I decided on the cream walls in the family room except for this accent wall. I felt so happy to be someone who had an accent wall in her home. This house wasn\\u2019t in my name but it was my house\\u2014it was the first house I had ever come close to sort of owning. And this accent wall had always made me feel like I was an adult who had her shit together. This accent wall was a lie. The deputy glares at us while riffling through our papers on the coffee table. Past-due notices and permission slips and postcards from the dentist reminding us it\\u2019s time for a teeth cleaning. The deputy upstairs shouts, and I know he\\u2019s found the drugs. Suddenly there are more deputies in the house. I hear the front door open and close, and DJ is handcuffed, and they are reading us our rights. My shoulders ache from the cuffs, and I can\\u2019t make sense of what\\u2019s happening in the chaos. I remember reading about spontaneous combustion when I was in middle school. How people can be going about their life, and suddenly they just implode and turn into a pile of ash on the ground. I was obsessed with this idea when I was thirteen. How a person could be there one minute and gone the next. How every problem, worry, math test, etc. could all disappear in an instant. As a kid, spontaneous combustion didn\\u2019t scare me\\u2014I was fascinated by the possibility. It gave me hope. I hear loud voices in the living room and awkwardly try to stand up without using my arms. \\u201cMy son\\u2026\\u201d I plead. \\u201cDo you understand the rights I have explained?\\u201d DJ nods. \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you tell me what else we\\u2019re going to find? Things will go easier on you if you tell me ahead of time. If you talk to me.\\u201d DJ shakes his head no again, and I\\u2019m not sure what to say. I don\\u2019t know what he means by go easier. \\u201cAre we under arrest?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cCan I call someone to pick up my son, please?\\u201d The other deputy is in the room now, holding the drugs. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got Child Protective Services here.\\u201d He gives me a dirty look. \\u201cPlease, can\\u2019t I call a family member to come get him? We have family who can be here in five minutes.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s too late for that.\\u201d \\u201cPlease\\u2026\\u201d I start to cry now and have no way to wipe my eyes. \\u201cAre you going to talk to us? It will make it easier on your baby if you do.\\u201d \\u201cWe aren\\u2019t saying anything, this is all bullshit!\\u201d DJ says angrily. My whole body is shaking, and I just want to get to Kaden. The deputy matches DJ\\u2019s anger and roughly grabs my elbow as I stand. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go, then.\\u201d He pulls me back toward the front door. Five strangers are gathered at the bottom of the stairs and through my open front door I see nothing but police cars in front of the house. Kaden runs to me when I get to the door. He is crying and holding his arms out for me to pick him up, but I can\\u2019t comfort him with my hands cuffed behind my back. I drop to my knees and his arms go around me. \\u201cMommmyyyy\\u2026\\u201d He is crying and burrowing his face into my neck. A man and a woman in dark suits are talking to the deputies. Child Protective Services. \\u201cI love you, baby,\\u201d I cry. \\u201cThese people are friends. It\\u2019s okay, they are going to take you somewhere for a while, but it\\u2019s okay, it\\u2019s okay\\u2026\\u201d He gets hysterical and tries to climb on me, his arms around my neck. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to go. Please, Mommy, please.\\u201d At that moment I split into two pieces. One is me floating on the ceiling and watching Kaden crying and pleading with the other me as strangers pry his arms from my body and pull him out the door. Kaden is there. And then Kaden is gone. I wish I could stay on the ceiling. I wish I could spontaneously combust. I wish I could go back in time and do everything differently. DJ and I are pulled outside. Our neighbors stand in front of their houses. Our cul-de-sac is full of police cars. All I can think is I did this. This is what I have done. \\n chapter 4 THE SALLY PORT The back of the police car smells like rust and vomit. DJ and I don\\u2019t say a word, and our hands are still cuffed behind our backs. I look down as we make the turn around the cul-de-sac. I know my neighbors are all outside, but I don\\u2019t want to see them. The deputy doesn\\u2019t say a word but glances at us in the rearview mirror periodically. DJ\\u2019s right knee moves up and down rapidly, and every few minutes he blows out a big gust of air as if he has just run a sprint. We drive past the Montessori school before getting on the freeway. The same school where at desperate moments over the last few months I would drive to at 8 a.m., even though my kids no longer went there, knowing that moms always leave their purses in their unlocked cars at private schools. Once they went inside, I would steal any cash I could find or a credit card if they didn\\u2019t have cash. And then I would slip back into my white SUV, perfect soccer mom camouflage, and tell myself that I was only using the money to feed my children. I never followed that virtuous thought all the way through to the truth behind it: I needed to steal money for food because I spent all my own money on drugs. It was so much easier to tell myself that I was only hurting the credit card companies, and that twenty dollars here or there meant nothing to these other parents. I duck my head in case anyone I know is driving in front of the school or stopped at the light and might see me in the back of a police car. DJ sees me do this. \\u201cFuck them,\\u201d he says. He always gets angry when he\\u2019s defensive, when he feels like he\\u2019s being attacked. The police car doesn\\u2019t pull into the jail parking lot but the county courthouse across the street. There\\u2019s a steep driveway that goes under the walkway between the side of the building that holds six or seven courtrooms and the side that holds the offices of the tax assessor, the county recorder, and the district attorney. I\\u2019ve never noticed this driveway before, or the underground area that traverses the whole complex. I dated an assistant DA back in college who showed me all around these buildings, but we never came down here. \\u201cWelcome to the tombs,\\u201d the deputy says over his shoulder. \\u201cWhy are we at the courthouse?\\u201d asks DJ. \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to talk to some detectives, they have some questions for you.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re not talking to anyone.\\u201d I don\\u2019t say anything as DJ and the deputy glare at each other. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not going to talk to the detectives?\\u201d Another deputy walks out of the tombs and up to the car as the driver lowers the window. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the problem?\\u201d \\u201cHe says he doesn\\u2019t want to answer any questions.\\u201d \\u201cWhat about her?\\u201d The deputy nods at me. \\u201cShe\\u2019s not answering questions either,\\u201d says DJ. Normally, as a good feminist, I would tell DJ I can speak for myself, but in this case I can\\u2019t speak. Even though it\\u2019s a bright sunny day outside, it is dark and eerie under the courthouse. I don\\u2019t like this place they call the tombs, and I definitely don\\u2019t want to go inside. The deputies and DJ argue, and I open my mouth to finally speak, but nothing comes out. \\u201cIt will be easier for you if you talk to the detectives.\\u201d \\u201cLike I said at the house, we\\u2019re not talking without our attorney.\\u201d DJ sounds important when he says this, and confident, but as far as I know we don\\u2019t have an attorney. The deputy from the tombs shrugs and steps away from the car. \\u201cTake them over to the jail and book \\u2019em.\\u201d DJ smiles like he\\u2019s won something. Until recently he was a mortgage broker, so that smarmy look comes easily to him. It\\u2019s a one-minute drive over to the county jail. The deputy pulls up to the side of the building. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to take you in one at a time. Do not make eye contact or talk to anyone in the sally port. There are cameras everywhere. We will see if you drop anything. We will see if you send a signal to anyone.\\u201d I have no idea what a sally port is and who or what we would be signaling. He takes DJ out of the back seat on the driver\\u2019s side first and then in through some double doors. They are tinted so I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on the other side. I swivel my head around looking for who I\\u2019m not supposed to signal or make eye contact with. All I see are police cars from all the different cities that make up this county\\u2014Watsonville, Santa Cruz, Capitola\\u2014but Aptos isn\\u2019t incorporated, it\\u2019s a village technically, so it\\u2019s under the domain of the sheriff. The other police cars are empty. I stare out the front window and then, one by one, I see three women poke their heads around the side of the building and then step out in front of me. They are wearing green pants and white shirts\\u2014like they are nurses or doctors. One of the women waves to me, but I can\\u2019t wave back. She has huge brown eyes and long, thick brown hair pulled into a high ponytail. The other two glance over at me then look away. They are wearing some kind of black hairnet and are discussing something intensely. All three women crouch down and look under the cars and then bolt upright and back around the building when the double doors slide open. The high ponytail woman pokes her head out one more time, grinning, and waves at me again as the deputy walks over to open the passenger-side back door. It\\u2019s not easy getting out without being able to use my arms. I\\u2019m weak and definitely haven\\u2019t been doing my squats, but I manage to stand and when I stumble a little, the deputy grabs my bicep tightly. Too tightly. He drags me stumbling toward the double doors, and they open automatically. We step inside and they quickly close behind us. There\\u2019s another set of double doors. I wait for them to open but they don\\u2019t. We stand there awkwardly. After a few minutes pass I take a deep breath. \\u201cCan you tell me where my son is, where they took him?\\u201d He ignores me. \\u201cPlease,\\u201d I beg, and my voice catches on the word. For the first time he looks right in my eyes and growls, \\u201cYou will never see him again.\\u201d I start to cry. \\u201cPlease, just tell me where he is, tell me if he\\u2019s okay.\\u201d He slowly looks me up and down. My hair is still a rat\\u2019s nest piled on top of my head. I\\u2019m wearing an old T-shirt, loose sweatshirt, and baggy pajama bottoms. I know my eyes are red and swollen from crying. A look of disgust comes over his face. \\u201cHe is better off without you. You should not be anyone\\u2019s mother.\\u201d He gives my bicep a hard squeeze as he says this, and then the double doors open and he pushes me inside. I want to push back but I don\\u2019t. I want to scream in protest, but all I can see in my mind is Kaden reaching out for me as he was taken away. Dylan, Cody, and Ty will be out of school by now. They must know what\\u2019s happened. The deputy\\u2019s words echo in my head. I will never see Kaden again. I will never see any of my boys again. I should not be anyone\\u2019s mother. I know what he says is true, and I hang my head. A tsunami of shame and grief and guilt and loss washes over me, and then there is nothing but numbness. I am grateful for the numbness. I am nobody\\u2019s mother. I am nothing. I get my picture taken and press each finger into black ink and onto a little card, and then I am locked in a cold cell the size of a changing room at Target. There\\u2019s a little window in the door and a pay phone on the wall and a bench in one corner. I sit on the bench and move my wrists in circles now that I am out of the handcuffs. Nothing happens for what feels like hours, and once in a while I peek out the window and see deputies come and go. If I tilt my head to the right, I can barely see another door with a small window and what I think is DJ\\u2019s face pressed against it. I stare at the pay phone. I don\\u2019t know who I\\u2019m supposed to call\\u2014who I could call. I shiver. It\\u2019s been roughly twelve hours since I last smoked heroin, and I\\u2019m about to start detoxing. I\\u2019ve never detoxed from heroin, but I\\u2019ve quit pills a million times so I think it will probably feel the same. Cold shivers, body aches, runny nose\\u2014basically the flu on steroids. I have a strong constitution, though, so I\\u2019ve always been able to hold my liquor, take twenty Vicodin and sound normal, detox, and not get too ravaged. I come from a long line of hardy Scandinavian women. I am descended from women who survived because they didn\\u2019t pass out in front of a Viking. I finally stand and pick up the pay phone. I don\\u2019t have money, so I press zero for the operator. \\u201cI need to place a collect call,\\u201d I say. I tell her the phone number and my name, and after a few minutes I hear the muted sound of a phone ringing. No one answers. \\u201cCan you try again?\\u201d I ask the operator. \\u201cShe just doesn\\u2019t recognize the number.\\u201d I hear the far-off sound of a phone ringing again and then, finally, it stops. \\u201cHello?\\u201d My mom has always answered the phone as if the house was on fire around her. \\u201cI have a collect call from Lara Love,\\u201d the operator says. \\u201cDo you accept the charges?\\u201d There is a long pause before she answers. \\u201cYes, I accept.\\u201d I wait a few seconds for the operator to hang up although I don\\u2019t know how collect calls work. Maybe she has to stay on to keep us connected. I would listen to collect calls if I had her job. I mean, how could you not? \\u201cMom?\\u201d \\u201cHold on,\\u201d my mom says. I can hear her fumbling and then the click of a lighter and a long drag on a Marlboro. I feel the same old annoyance at her smoking that I have felt since I was a kid. But then I remember where I am: no place to judge. \\u201cMom\\u2026\\u201d My voice cracks, and I feel the tears start all over again. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have any money,\\u201d she says. \\u201cYour bail is two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cDJ\\u2019s mom called me. You know I don\\u2019t have that kind of money. Oh, Lara, this must be a mistake. Carol said there was a gun in the back of your car.\\u201d \\u201cWhat are you talking about?\\u201d \\u201cYou have gun charges against you. And drugs and robbery and\\u2026\\u201d Her voice fades off, and I don\\u2019t know what to say. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have any guns, that\\u2019s wrong.\\u201d I listen as she takes a long drag again and blows it heavily into the phone. \\u201cWhat about Kaden?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cDid she say anything to you about Kaden, about where he is? Or the other boys?\\u201d \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cCan you please call her back and ask her? I\\u2019m sure she\\u2019s talking to DJ. And then I\\u2019ll call you back.\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t deal with this tonight, Lara. It\\u2019s too much. There\\u2019s nothing I can do. This must be DJ\\u2019s fault.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s not, Mom. This is all my fault.\\u201d I start to cry again. The little holding cell echoes with my sobs and a high-pitched wail that comes from somewhere deep inside me. I try to say \\u201cMom\\u201d again, but I am choking on my tears and snot. I try to get it together, but I can\\u2019t. My mom doesn\\u2019t say a word, or if she does I can no longer hear her. I hang up and slide down the wall to the floor. I\\u2019m grateful she can\\u2019t call me back. Grateful no one can reach me in this place. I lift my forehead a few inches and then bring it down hard against the cement floor. I do this a few more times and although it hurts, I\\u2019m too weak to do any real damage so I just lie on the floor and do something I haven\\u2019t done since I was a kid. I pray. The same prayer that\\u2019s probably been said a billion times in every little holding cell in every jail throughout the world. \\u201cHelp,\\u201d I pray. \\u201cPlease help\\u2026\\u201d I am still curled up on the floor hours later when the door opens. A female guard brings in an older woman who is obviously drunk. She\\u2019s wearing a sparkly cocktail dress, and her eyes are watery, and her mascara is smeared in such a way that each eye looks like a smiley face. I stand up, thinking the guard must be taking me out if she\\u2019s bringing this woman in but she shuts the door quickly, and the woman and I are both left in this tiny room. \\u201cHi,\\u201d she says brightly. I sit down on the bench and press myself as far against the back wall as I can and keep my eyes down. The woman sighs loudly and then immediately picks up the pay phone. \\u201cHello? Hello?\\u201d she yells into the receiver. \\u201cHello?\\u201d \\u201cYou have to dial zero,\\u201d I say. \\u201cAnd then give the operator the number for a collect call.\\u201d The woman smiles at me and sways a little bit on her heels. I look down again so she can be messy-drunk with a little privacy. She tells the operator the number and slurs her name. Helen comes out as Schmelen, so she says it again and then kicks off her shoes while she waits. \\u201cJohnnie, it\\u2019s me Schmelen, Johnnieeeeee! I was at the Hindquarter and I had a couple of cocktails before schdinner and maybe one glass of schwine, and they pulled me over and said I was schweaving in traffic. I\\u2019m at the schnail.\\u201d Helen goes silent while Johnnie responds, and she tries to put her shoes back on but ends up kicking one so that it rolls over and lands near my foot. \\u201cI am not a drunk driver who drives drunk,\\u201d Helen screams into the phone. \\u201cCome get me right now, this is ridiculumous!\\u201d Helen slams the phone down and bends over to grab her shoe. She plops down on the bench next to me. \\u201cWhy is it so cold in here?\\u201d I shrug. I have never been good at small talk. Helen looks me up and down, pauses on my swollen eyes. \\u201cSo whass happened to you?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know how to answer this question. \\u201cIs this your first time in the schnail?\\u201d I nod. \\u201cMe too, and it\\u2019s so ridiculust, I am not drunk. I just went out to dinner with some of my girlfriends.\\u201d The whole cell smells like alcohol, but I\\u2019m not going to point out the obvious, so I just nod again. \\u201cSo what happened to you?\\u201d \\u201cI was arrested at home. They wouldn\\u2019t let me call someone to pick up my three-year-old son. I have no idea where he is.\\u201d Helen is immediately outraged on my behalf. \\u201cThat\\u2019s ridiculous, they shouldn\\u2019t not do that\\u2014why can\\u2019t you call someone and say that?\\u201d I start to cry again, and Helen pats my back a few times. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll be out of here soon, and you can get your son, and I can get my car back. Can you believe they had it towed? Do the police have nothing better to dos? It\\u2019s outragulous, and I need my car!\\u201d I smile weakly at her. \\u201cThere you go. See, it\\u2019s all not going to be not okay.\\u201d I can\\u2019t even unwrap her double negative, but I close my eyes and pretend she\\u2019s right for a minute. The door opens and it\\u2019s the same female deputy who brought in Helen. \\u201cLove, let\\u2019s go!\\u201d \\u201cSee,\\u201d says Helen. \\u201cYou can go get your son now. Good lucks to you!\\u201d I give Helen a little wave and walk out the door. I know I\\u2019m not being released but I don\\u2019t want to ruin her happy-drunk vibe with the truth. The deputy walks me into a small room. Shelves line the walls, and there are stacks of maroon clothing organized by size. It\\u2019s like a small sad thrift store. She hands me a shirt and a pair of pants. Then she opens a drawer and pulls out a gray sports bra and a pair of giant green underwear and hands them to me. \\u201cTake everything off and put your things in this bag.\\u201d She hands me a used brown paper bag and I look around to see where I\\u2019m supposed to change. \\u201cGo ahead, take everything off.\\u201d I\\u2019m awkwardly holding the new clothes and the brown bag and there\\u2019s nothing to set anything down on. \\u201cHere?\\u201d I ask. She gives me a weird look and nods. I drop the brown bag and set the pile of jail clothes on the floor. I start to turn around but the deputy stops me. \\u201cFace forward, remove all your clothes and put them in the bag.\\u201d I pull off my sweatshirt and T-shirt at the same time. I\\u2019m not wearing a bra. I put them in the bag. The guard stares at me. I slide my sweatpants down but leave my socks on. I wasn\\u2019t wearing shoes when they arrested me. \\u201cTake off the socks too.\\u201d I take those off and put them and my sweats in the bag. I don\\u2019t fold anything\\u2014just shove it inside the bag. I am freezing now. I\\u2019ve lost so much weight in the last year that my hip bones and collarbones protrude and I actually have a six-pack. I don\\u2019t work out, but without any body fat it looks like I do. I bend over to pick up the maroon pants but the deputy stops me. \\u201cSquat down,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cSquat down. Knees out.\\u201d I do what she says. \\u201cStand up, turn around, and then bend over pulling your ass cheeks apart.\\u201d I do it, and she doesn\\u2019t say anything, so I just stay bent over. For some reason I think of Helen. I hope she doesn\\u2019t have to do this. She will definitely fall. \\u201cOkay, get dressed.\\u201d I quickly pull on the giant underwear, pull the sports bra over my head, and step into the maroon pants and shirt. \\u201cPut the T-shirt on first.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t realize that under the stiff maroon pullover was a brown cotton T-shirt. I put that on instead. \\u201cYou have to put the red on when you leave your cell. This is your ID card. Keep it with you and make sure you have it every time you leave your cell.\\u201d I look at her blankly. \\u201cNow put your red shirt on.\\u201d I do as she says and then put my ID card in the front pocket without looking at it. She hands me a pair of slip-on woven sandals. \\u201cPut these on and follow me.\\u201d I slide on the sandals and look at my toenails sticking out and cringe\\u2014I have definitely deprioritized mani-pedis during my criminal phase. Who knew jail would be open toe? She picks up my bag of clothes with gloved hands and carries it under one arm. I walk behind her, back out to the main part of the jail. She hands the bag to another deputy behind the front desk. \\u201cLove,\\u201d she says. He laughs. \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cLast name is Love.\\u201d She shrugs. He takes a black Magic Marker and writes my last name on the bag and throws it on the counter behind him. I see there\\u2019s another bag marked Jackson. DJ must have already done all of this. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d I follow her through a series of locked doors. They get buzzed open and closed from somewhere else. Each door we walk through slams shut behind me, and there\\u2019s a loud grating noise as it locks. I startle every time. \\u201cFollow the yellow line,\\u201d she says, pointing to a painted line on the slate-gray floor. I walk along the line down hallways that lead through two more sets of loud, locking doors. Finally, we enter a large circular room. In the center of the room are steps leading up to a raised pavilion of some kind. There are two guards behind glass windows in front of what looks like computer monitors. I look around and see that the circular room is more like a hexagon, with a thick door and window on each section. There\\u2019s a clock on the wall\\u2014it\\u2019s 2 a.m. I wonder where Kaden is sleeping. It\\u2019s been twelve hours since he was taken. How did he get to sleep? I imagine him all alone. I imagine strangers hurting him. A cold terror engulfs me. I frantically look around. I have to get out of here. I have to get to him. Behind one of the windows DJ is waving to me. \\u201cNo communication with other inmates. No signals, no signs, nothing,\\u201d the deputy yells, waving at DJ to back away from the window. A male guard steps out of the pavilion and hands what looks like a yoga mat and a sheet and blanket to the deputy. \\u201cHere you go. We don\\u2019t have any mugs or hygiene. We\\u2019ll get them in the morning. He turns his head and yells into his shoulder, \\u201cOpening G!\\u201d My escort deputy grabs the mat from him and shoves it into my arms. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go,\\u201d she says, and we walk over to one side of the hexagon. The door groans loudly as it opens. \\u201cWelcome to G block,\\u201d she says, and pushes me inside. I am in a large semicircular room. There are faint lights on the ceiling and to my right a stairway leads to a long balcony with six doors. Right under the balcony is a lower level with another six doors. Between those doors and me is what looks like a school cafeteria\\u2014a cluster of small tables bolted to the floor. Between the cafeteria tables and the closed doors are about ten bunk beds, forming a perimeter around the entire room. I look behind me, but the deputy is gone. I have no idea what I\\u2019m supposed to do. I can\\u2019t tell if there are people in the beds or not\\u2014if there are, they aren\\u2019t moving. I take a few steps forward and then freeze. \\u201cHey.\\u201d I hear a muffled voice coming from somewhere in front of me and look around in the dark. I can\\u2019t see anyone, but I hear the voice again. \\u201cHey!\\u201d I walk through the group of tables and stop in front of the ring of bunk beds. The bunk to my left is empty\\u2014just a bare metal grate. I throw my skinny yoga mat mattress on top and see that the mat fits into the frame perfectly. I throw the thin sheet and blanket on top as well. I have no idea if this is my assigned bed. \\u201cHey!\\u201d The voice sounds closer but still muffled. I walk between the bunk beds and stop in front of the row of doors. Each door has a small square window three-quarters of the way up, and I scan back and forth until I see a woman\\u2019s face in the door to my left. Her face fills the entire square, and I can see that she\\u2019s saying something, but it\\u2019s too muffled to hear. I walk closer. She gives me a little wave and then points her finger down. I don\\u2019t know if she\\u2019s the welcome wagon or what. Is she going to tell me where to sleep? I look down on the ground in front of me where I think she\\u2019s pointing but don\\u2019t see anything. She points again and raises her eyebrows at me and then waves me closer. I get a little closer and she points down at my waist. I have no idea what she wants but I definitely do not want to take my clothes off again. I shake my head at her, but she just points down again. She holds a finger to her lips telling me to be quiet. I am so confused. I take another step and reach my hand out to the door, thinking she wants me to open it. I turn the knob and pull but it doesn\\u2019t budge. I try again. She immediately starts to laugh, and suddenly her voice isn\\u2019t muffled. It\\u2019s loud. I look around me and I see other faces pressed to the windows. \\u201cTry mine next,\\u201d someone yells. More laughter. I\\u2019m embarrassed but have no idea what I\\u2019ve done. The girl in the window laughs and flips me off. I return to my bunk. \\u201cCome open my door,\\u201d yells another voice, and there\\u2019s more laughter. \\u201cShut the fuck up,\\u201d a voice yells from one of the top bunks across the room. I look around and see about ten women sitting up in various bunks\\u2014all looking at me. Some are laughing. I didn\\u2019t know then that the bunk beds are called the freeway\\u2014where the lower class of inmates sleep. Those with no connections, no street cred, and first-timers like me who are unknown and automatically suspect. I don\\u2019t know that the Black girls, the Bible thumpers, the homeless transients, and the harmless mentally ill are also kept out here. Jail is a class system, and a study in racial segregation worthy of the South in the 1950s. There are rules I don\\u2019t know. A system I can\\u2019t comprehend. A hustle I have never learned. A power structure that is somewhere between an adolescent sleepover party and being jumped into a gang. I quickly lie down in my bunk and pull the blanket over my head. I have no idea that my one little gesture\\u2014trying to open a locked cell door\\u2014told everyone in G block all they needed to know about me. I have never been to jail before and I\\u2019ve brought nothing in\\u2014meaning there\\u2019s no stash of drugs packed in my vagina that I could use to establish myself, work my hustle, flex my power, or be invited to move into one of the locked-door cells that had more privacy. Under the blanket, my mind runs through the last twelve hours, starting with the knock on the door and ending with the woman in the cell flipping me off. Maybe I am dead, and this is my bespoke hell. \\n chapter 5 COUNTRY MUSIC HELL Hank Williams Jr. is in my house. My head is pounding, and I\\u2019m not sure if I\\u2019m awake or asleep. I reach my arm out to my right to see if Kaden has climbed into bed again, and my hand hits cold cement. Cold cement. I sit up wildly, a scream building in the back of my throat, and the top of my head scrapes across hard metal. I imagine Kaden waking up somewhere with strangers. I worry again that someone has hurt him in the night, and there is a thickness in my throat that I can\\u2019t swallow away. I slowly look around G block. To my left is a woman sitting up in the bottom of another bunk bed. She has long, stringy brown hair. She\\u2019s slowly licking a green Jolly Rancher and staring at me from behind the brown curtain of her hair. Her eyes glitter with hatred. In front of all the cafeteria tables and right below the side of the stairway, there is a television mounted on the wall. In front of it four women are singing along to a country music video and performing a synchronized dance routine. I look around to see if there\\u2019s some kind of brochure or instructions about what I should do next. I have to pee, but I have no idea where I\\u2019m supposed to do that. Apart from the girl with the Jolly Rancher, nobody looks my way as I sit up in bed. I feel lost. How did I get so lost? I stare at the country music video. It\\u2019s a man sitting on a barstool singing to a bartender about breaking parole. The four women are singing along at the top of their lungs with their arms locked together and shuffling right and then left with some complicated crossover foot movement in the middle. Three women on the top-tier balcony start clapping and yelling \\u201cyeehaw!\\u201d They join in on the chorus about jacking keys and crashing a car. A guard opens the main door into G block, and the women on the balcony start dancing and then singing even louder. As he walks across the floor below, they scream the lyrics at him. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough. Quiet down!\\u201d he yells, but the girls just sing louder and do a weaving do-si-do with each other. The final lyrics are about going back to the pen to see friends. The guard doesn\\u2019t yell again, just shakes his head while the song finishes. He walks in front of the bottom row of doors and peeks in each window if the door is closed. He opens one door and snarls at the woman inside, \\u201cNo covering the window. Take it down!\\u201d He points to a postcard in the window. I can\\u2019t see the picture on her side, but on the white side that faces out red block letters say: WISH YOU WERE HERE. My tears start again, so I lie back down and turn toward the wall. My mind races, wondering if Kaden thinks we are gone forever, that we\\u2019ve just given him away or that he\\u2019s been stolen. He\\u2019s at that age where he turns his head away if a stranger talks to him. He can only fall asleep if someone lightly scratches his arm. I can\\u2019t endure these thoughts, so I sit back up in my bunk. The woman with the Jolly Rancher is still staring at me, and she slowly pulls it out of her mouth and holds it up to show me the sharp point she\\u2019s fashioned. She angles it toward me. Over and over, she air-shanks me with her little green sticky shiv. I stay in my bed all day. I don\\u2019t eat when they bring food in on trays for breakfast. I don\\u2019t eat lunch either. No one speaks to me. I turn my back to the room and face the cement wall. Eventually, I have to get up to pee. I can only hold it so long. I do a long, slow walk around the room, trying to be cool, but really I\\u2019m just looking for the bathroom. The other girls stop talking when I walk by them, and then they whisper and stare. I am sure they are talking about me. At its core, addiction is an extreme form of self-obsession. We addicts are pathologically self-absorbed, self-serving, selfish, and all the other self- words. The drug is our secret lover, our treasured best friend, and our primary relationship. We live in service to that relationship, and it drives and colors every interaction we have. Are you a friend or foe to my using? Will you help me or thwart me? Like any compulsion, the rituals of using are a solace. How could anyone else ever understand our terminal uniqueness? So of course I think they are talking about me\\u2014matching the running commentary in my own mind. I listen to snatches of conversation as I walk: Apparently, Jolly Rancher hasn\\u2019t showered in four days, and a group of girls\\u2014the ones who were dancing on the top tier\\u2014are planning an intervention. They are going to force-shower her while one girl keeps lookout. I have always been good at eavesdropping and reading lips, and I can usually see schemes unfolding. I am a master at subtext and plot and body language, so I know the stringy-haired girl is about to get a very violent and cold washing. Even though I am freezing, many of the girls have stripped down to their sports bras. I pick up that the non-showered girl also didn\\u2019t turn in her old clothes for new ones in the last two clothing exchanges. This, along with a general lack of personal hygiene, has made her the biggest problem in G block. I don\\u2019t dare walk up the stairs to the top tier. I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s allowed, but I do notice there\\u2019s a mop bucket at the bottom of the stairs. One girl with short brown hair, styled like Victoria Beckham, sees me looking at the bucket. \\u201cWe used to have a big container of bleach next to that,\\u201d she says, \\u201cbut someone did something stupid and got the bleach thrown in her face.\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure how to reply. Is she threatening me? I don\\u2019t meet her eyes and instead stare at the large black spider tattooed on her throat. The spider\\u2019s legs wrap around to the back of her neck, and when she smiles, it looks like two of the legs are moving toward her face from under her chin. Is she the one who threw the bleach? These women don\\u2019t look particularly scary or violent, but I have no idea if I\\u2019m surrounded by killers and bleach throwers. Really the only person who sort of threatened me did so with a piece of candy. One girl who looks to be about six months pregnant is playing cards with two other women, who could pass for twins. What happens when she has her baby? Will the baby be in some sort of baby jail, or will CPS take the baby away as soon as it\\u2019s born? I smile back at the spider-face girl and nod knowingly about people who do stupid things and get bleach thrown in their face. I also notice a hot pot of water on a small table next to the mop bucket. Not boiling water apparently, but hot enough that two girls who smuggled in some contraband real coffee into the unit are using the corner of a bedsheet as a filter to make some fresh brew. I come to a row of phones on the wall. I know I should call my mom back since I just hung up on her yesterday. But these aren\\u2019t pay phones, so I just stand in front of them looking stupid. I pick up a receiver and hold it to my ear. \\u201cYou need to dial your S number to make a call. Do you have minutes?\\u201d It\\u2019s spider girl being helpful again, but I smile and shrug like she\\u2019s speaking a foreign language. \\u201cOn your ID card.\\u201d I pull the card out of my shirt pocket. There\\u2019s a number on it below my picture. I dial it into the phone and follow the recorded instructions for placing a collect call. My mom answers right away but takes a long time to accept the charges. I imagine she\\u2019s grasping for her cigarettes and lighter. There\\u2019s no privacy in the room so I whisper into the phone when she says hello. \\u201cHi.\\u201d She says hello back and then asks if I know how much the charges might be. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have a lot of money,\\u201d she adds. \\u201cI know. I\\u2019ll be quick. Have you talked to Carol or anyone?\\u201d \\u201cI spoke to Carol again this morning. Your bail is still set at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. For each of you.\\u201d \\u201cWhat? That doesn\\u2019t make sense.\\u201d \\u201cCarol is pretty furious. Lala, what did you do?\\u201d She hasn\\u2019t used my childhood nickname in a long time. \\u201cI can\\u2019t really talk about that now,\\u201d I say. I don\\u2019t want to talk in front of everyone, and I don\\u2019t want to start crying. \\u201cCarol said the felony charges add up to twenty-seven years in prison. I don\\u2019t have money for an attorney, you know that. I don\\u2019t know what to do.\\u201d She starts to cry a little. I can\\u2019t deal with her tears. All I want to do is hang up and get back in bed. \\u201cCall me back later if you can. I\\u2019ll see what else I can find out.\\u201d \\u201cMom\\u2026\\u201d I stop speaking for a second and swallow the lump in my throat. I take a big breath. \\u201cDid she say where Kaden is?\\u201d I don\\u2019t ask her about my older boys because I know they\\u2019re with their dad. My mom is silent now except for her own big inhale of nicotine. \\u201cNo, she has no idea.\\u201d I need to get off the phone and back to my cement wall. I cannot cry in front of all these women. \\u201cI love you, Mom, and I\\u2019m so sorry\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cOh, Lara\\u2026\\u201d She starts to say more but I hang up. My eyes are swimming with tears, and I stumble my way back to bed. Twenty-seven years. I start doing the math in my head. Kaden would be almost thirty-one, Ty forty, Cody forty-three, Dylan forty-four. This cannot be real. I didn\\u2019t kill anyone. My boys are going to grow up without me. I have lost them all. When a new guard comes in the afternoon and hands me a clear plastic bag, I inspect it closely. There\\u2019s a roll of toilet paper, a toothbrush, a small, unmarked tube of what I\\u2019m guessing is toothpaste, a tiny bar of soap, and a plastic razor. I pull the razor out and twist and pull the top apart to see if there\\u2019s an actual razor in there that I can use but there\\u2019s not. There\\u2019s also a small pen and a few pages of notepaper in the bag. The pen is just the plastic inside of a pen, and it\\u2019s hard to hold or write with. I try anyway. I write my boys\\u2019 names across the top of a sheet of paper. Dylan. Cody. Ty. Kaden. I rub my finger across their names slowly. The last seventeen years play across my mind. Birthday parties and karate lessons and baseball games and basketball tournaments and school plays and vacations. I tried so hard to be who they needed me to be. I tried to be the right kind of mother. But I\\u2019ve just failed. I\\u2019ve failed them and I\\u2019ve failed at life. Dear Boys, I\\u2019m so sorry. I love you more than anything in the whole wide world. I pray that addiction never gets ahold of you. Always take care of each other. I love you so much. Mom I have decided to end my life. It feels like the best decision I have made in a long time. I want that sweet relief. I can\\u2019t take another moment of not knowing where Kaden is, of thinking I won\\u2019t see my boys again until they are grown men. I am freezing cold, and my head aches, and I feel like I won\\u2019t ever sleep again. Every part of my body hurts, but the pain in my mind is the most unbearable. I read the letter again. My spark has gone out. Even in the day-to-day misery of addiction, there was a little spark that kept me going. Now I feel no inner strength or spark or flicker of anything resembling hope. I am a black hole that has swallowed all the light, and I want a quick end to my dark life. It sounds dramatic, but it doesn\\u2019t feel dramatic. It just feels right. As I form my suicide plan, a peace washes over me. My mind stops racing, my nausea goes away, even the chills and headache disappear. I float on a calm black lake of no thought. I fold the note carefully and tuck it under my pillow. Someone will find it after I\\u2019m dead, and my boys will know I thought of them, that in my last moments I had nothing but love for them. When I imagine their lives without me, it feels better, easier for them to have a dead mom than a prison mom. After everyone is asleep I\\u2019m going to walk up the stairs and hang myself from the top railing with my bedsheet. At 10 p.m. the guard comes in and yells \\u201cLights out!\\u201d I am wide awake when he comes back at eleven and again at midnight. I figure out the routine. He walks around the freeway, peeks in all the locked-door windows, then walks upstairs and checks all those rooms. It takes about five minutes every time he makes his rounds. After the 1 a.m. check, I wait a few minutes until after he leaves and then I sit up in bed. I slowly wrap the sheet around my neck, tying it in what I hope are six strong knots. I can still hear some girls whispering, so I lie back down to wait until it\\u2019s quiet. I tell myself that I will be gone within the hour, and a little thrill courses through me. I\\u2019ve never been overly afraid of death\\u2014have always thought of it as this next big adventure where the mysteries of the universe will be revealed. I don\\u2019t believe in heaven or hell. I believe we are all energy coming back lifetime after lifetime until we learn what we need to learn. I need to take a mulligan on this lifetime. The only thing that ever scared me about death was the idea of my boys missing me, hurting because I was gone. But I\\u2019m already gone, so I believe this will be easier for them, cleaner. I lie in my bunk and try to remember the first time I took an opiate. I had knee surgery in high school after tearing a ligament playing lacrosse, but I don\\u2019t remember taking anything for pain after surgery, although I must have. The fact that I don\\u2019t remember the pills means I took them as prescribed, and they simply did their job. In my second year of graduate school I tore the same ligament. I was skipping down a hallway and the previously repaired ligament simply gave out. It required surgery, even though I was four months pregnant with Dylan, and when they hooked me up to a morphine pump I refused to press the button. The orthopedic surgeon and my ob-gyn both assured me it wouldn\\u2019t hurt the baby. The nurses tried to get me to push the button, but I wouldn\\u2019t. I do remember the first time I took a pain pill when I wasn\\u2019t in pain. I was in Visalia, California. I was not married to Dylan\\u2019s father; in fact, we had only spent a few weeks together for what was supposed to be a summer fling before I found out I was pregnant. I had a baby daddy before baby daddies were a thing. Bryan and I barely knew each other; we were both twenty-four-year-old wannabe writers and broke. His family was meeting their grandchild and me for the first time. I had just finished graduate school, was carrying an extra forty pounds of baby weight on my sleep-deprived body, and not feeling like my best self. And while I was madly in love with my baby, I was distant with his dad. Bryan had cheated on me during the pregnancy, and I was hurt and guarded with him. I wanted so badly to create the family I never had, but I had no skills to do that. Our relationship was supposed to just be a one-night stand, but I had fallen in love with the possibility of being loved. And on the night we had drunkenly conceived, a beautiful curly-haired toddler had appeared in my dreams. I was filled with a love I had never experienced before, and when I woke up, hungover, I ached for that little boy in my dream. I missed him desperately. When I found out a few weeks later that I was pregnant, I knew instantly I would have the baby and that he would be a boy. Bryan\\u2019s dad and grandfather adored the baby, and they proudly took a photo of four generations of men carrying the Love surname. It was beautiful, and my family-starved soul was happy my son would have this Love legacy. He would have a family. But I felt like Oliver Twist with his hands out begging for food. The Loves were skeptical and suspicious of me, and worried for Bryan that because we were not married, I could eventually take the baby from all of them. On the second day of our visit, I used the master bathroom and there on the counter was a giant prescription bottle of Percocet. Hundreds of pills. I read the label: TAKE 1\\u20132 PILLS EVERY FOUR HOURS OR AS NEEDED FOR PAIN. I had no ominous music playing in the background. No precognition of what this tiny pill could do. It was 1991, and the opioid crisis wasn\\u2019t yet a crisis. I opened the top and shook out a pill. With a palmful of water from the sink, I swallowed it, dried off my chin with a bath towel, and steeled myself for another dinner with a family who gave me smiles that didn\\u2019t quite reach their eyes. Twenty minutes later I felt a rush of warmth and joy and happiness flow through my body. My anxiety evaporated. I told funny stories. I showed intense interest in their vending machine business. The Percocet opened my heart, and I saw a million loving family dinners just like this one. For the first time ever, I really felt like I belonged somewhere. I had taken that pill as needed for pain and my pain had gone away. The next day, as we said our goodbyes and promised to see each other again soon, I still felt the warmth and glow from that one pill. And from the forty pills I had hidden in my purse. As I lay in the dark waiting for everyone to fall asleep, I think about redemption, about second chances, and while I believe in them, I know that this time they are not for me. Redemption is for the good, and deep down I have always known that I am bad. \\n chapter 6 MAKEOVER I am stepping off a cliff and falling, falling, falling toward something with teeth. I wave my arms in the air, knowing instantly that this is a horrible mistake. I didn\\u2019t mean to step off the edge. I flail and flap and try to reverse course and even though I am screaming the only sound is the scraping and gnashing of giant teeth that rush toward me from below. I am blinded as a giant spotlight rises out of the teeth and hits me straight in the eyes. I jerk upright, startled, and clamp down on a scream. The scraping sound is tall stacks of chairs being moved across the floor. The lights are on, and a guard is yelling, \\u201cBreakfast, ladies, rise and shine.\\u201d An overhead light blares right in my eyes, and as I turn my head away the entire top sheet of my bed moves with me. It takes a minute for me to realize what\\u2019s happening. Chairs. Guards. Breakfast. A sheet tied in six knots around my neck. I quickly lie back down in my bunk and pull the blanket over my head. How could I have fallen asleep? The last thing I remember is waiting for the girls to stop talking. I claw desperately at the knots around my neck, afraid someone might have seen them when I sat up. I am mortified. Embarrassed. I am ashamed that I am still alive. It takes me five minutes to undo all the knots, but it feels like hours. I am sure that when I come out from under my blanket all of G block will be staring at me. Of course, everyone is eating and not looking at the new girl hiding under a blanket on the freeway. It doesn\\u2019t cross my mind that I have a suicide note under my pillow, and I should ask for help\\u2014I am just angry that I have to endure another twelve or sixteen hours of living until I can try again. I\\u2019ve detoxed from opiates before, and there\\u2019s no way I should have fallen asleep. It doesn\\u2019t feel like a miracle, it feels like punishment. I am shivering and my entire body is aching, so I will also have to endure the worst of detoxing during this long day of being alive. \\u201cS-201761!\\u201d The guard is yelling some random numbers, but everyone ignores him. \\u201cS-201761, get ready for court in ten!\\u201d Each syllable feels like a nail to my head and I close my eyes and hope he stops. I don\\u2019t know why he has to scream; everyone is quiet in G block. The country music videos haven\\u2019t even started up. \\u201cLove!\\u201d My eyes fly open, and I raise my hand like I\\u2019m about to answer a question in school. One of the girls eating at a table sees me and snorts out a laugh. \\u201cYou have court in ten. Get ready!\\u201d With that the guard walks out of G block. I don\\u2019t understand what he means, but I slowly get out of my bunk. The girl who snorted looks at me. \\u201cIs Love your last name?\\u201d I nod. \\u201cThat number he called out is your S-number\\u2014it\\u2019s on your ID card. If your name is Love there\\u2019s no way he\\u2019s gonna yell that out if he can help it.\\u201d She laughs. \\u201cBetter learn your number, because that\\u2019s your name now, and you need to bring your ID with you whenever you leave G.\\u201d \\u201cHe said I have court?\\u201d The girl just shrugs and goes back to her breakfast. \\u201cHey, I\\u2019m Nina.\\u201d A small girl, not even five feet tall, with a short brown bob that seems strangely freshly styled, stands up from the table. \\u201cThey take you to your court dates in the morning, but you could be in the tombs all day. You might want to eat something and like, fix your hair or something.\\u201d She waves vaguely at my face and hair, and I\\u2019m instantly embarrassed. I find the door to the communal bathroom for the freeway dwellers, and two girls standing in the corner together scurry out without saying a word to me. Later I will find out that this is the one part of G block where the cameras can\\u2019t see you if you live on the freeway. This corner is where girls will go to fight or squash a potential fight, to share their drugs, or to plot and plan. There is a semblance of a mirror above the sink. The toilet is out in the open. The locked-door cells each have a toilet and sink in them. Going to the bathroom in public is one of the joys of incarceration. I have the bladder of a sloth, so I can go days without using the bathroom. And there\\u2019s no water to drink that I know of, so I feel weak and dehydrated. I tell myself I just have to get through the day, and then I can finish what I started last night. I look at myself in the mirror. My hair has been up in a bun since my arrest and I\\u2019m afraid to try to take it down. I don\\u2019t have a comb or brush. The mirror is made of murky metal, not glass, and it shows a warped version of my face that probably looks better than I actually do right now. My eyes are red and painful and watering constantly from the detox. I lean over the sink and splash water on my face. Even this minimal exertion leaves me exhausted. I pat water on my tangled hair. I don\\u2019t know what else to do. A girl walks in the bathroom and I startle. \\u201cHey,\\u201d she says. \\u201cHey.\\u201d \\u201cYou done with the mirror?\\u201d I nod yes and go over to the toilet. I really do need to pee; even sloths have their limits. She is carrying a cup and a pack of colored pencils. I watch as she takes out a black pencil, dips it in the cup, then uses the pencil as eyeliner. She then takes out a red pencil and dips it and then draws circles on each cheek and rubs them with her fingers. She dips the pencil again and it becomes lip liner. She takes out a pink pencil and dips it and that becomes lipstick. She then takes the white pencil, dips it in the cup, and uses it to whiten up the corners of each eye. I\\u2019m still on the toilet. I\\u2019m done peeing, but I\\u2019m transfixed by her makeover. Plus, it\\u2019s just a nice place to rest. \\u201cYou have court?\\u201d she asks when she\\u2019s finished. I nod yes. \\u201cMe too. Do you want me to do your makeup? No offense, but you are looking a little ragged.\\u201d I wipe and pull up my pants. \\u201cSure, thanks,\\u201d I say and walk over to the sink. She steps away while I wash my hands. There\\u2019s nothing to dry them with so I wipe them on my pants. \\u201cLet me get some more hot water.\\u201d She walks out of the communal bathroom, leaving her pack of colored pencils, and comes back a minute later with the cup. \\u201cYou need really hot water for the pencil color, so I have to get it out of the hot pot, not the sink.\\u201d I nod like this makes perfect sense to me. \\u201cSo what do you want?\\u201d \\u201cUmm, maybe just some color on my cheeks.\\u201d She laughs. \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re looking a little gray. Meth?\\u201d \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cH?\\u201d I nod. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s your name?\\u201d \\u201cLara.\\u201d \\u201cIs your last name really Love?\\u201d I nod again. She laughs at this. \\u201cI\\u2019m Kiki or Little K,\\u201d she says. \\u201cHold still. I don\\u2019t have any mascara, they\\u2019re out in commissary, but this is better than nothing. There are always lots of homeboys in the tombs, so you gotta look good on court day.\\u201d I nod like I know this already. \\u201cWhen did you get picked up?\\u201d she asks. \\u201cYesterday.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s weird you have court already; it usually takes at least a few days. Has Classification been to see you yet?\\u201d I have no idea what she\\u2019s talking about, but I\\u2019m trying to be cool during my makeover, so I just say no and shrug. She doesn\\u2019t ask me what I was arrested for, and I don\\u2019t offer any information or think to ask her anything. \\u201cLet me just do a little something with those eyes.\\u201d Kiki dips various pencils in and out of the cup of hot water and works on my eyes. \\u201cJust a little brown in the creases will help and I\\u2019m going to use the white to take away all the red. You\\u2019ll feel better in a couple of days. Detoxing off H is the worst. I\\u2019ll make you a hot water bottle when you get back, it will help with the chills. We save all the OJ containers and fill them from the hot pot. Helps with cramps\\u2014although we\\u2019re all synced up in here so there\\u2019s a shortage once a month\\u2014and it helps with the heroin detox. The meth heads just sleep for two weeks with their detox. Lucky bitches.\\u201d I take in all this information and look at myself in the mirror. I look much better than I did a few minutes ago. \\u201cThanks,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThanks so much!\\u201d Kiki packs up her pencils and walks to the bathroom door. \\u201cThis your first time?\\u201d she asks. I nod. \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. The first few days are the roughest. It will get better.\\u201d My eyes start to well up from her kindness, but I blink the tears away so I don\\u2019t mess up her work. \\u201cBut stay away from Daddy. She likes to make it rough for the newbies. She\\u2019ll roll you up if she doesn\\u2019t like you.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know who Daddy is\\u2014I only know Nina and Spider Girl and now Kiki\\u2014and I don\\u2019t know what it means to get rolled up, but I\\u2019m not going to ask. Kiki is young and blond and tall and looks like she could be a model if prison clothes were a fashion line. \\u201cHow old are you?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cI\\u2019m nineteen.\\u201d \\u201cWow,\\u201d I say. She\\u2019s only a couple of years older than Dylan. \\u201cI know,\\u201d she says. \\u201cBut I\\u2019ve been in and out of here like ten times already, not to mention juvie. How old are you?\\u201d \\u201cForty-one,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWow,\\u201d she says back. \\u201cI know\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019ll probably be out by the weekend, don\\u2019t worry.\\u201d She gives me a big smile, and I offer a weak one in return. We walk out of the bathroom together, and I hope the colored pencil makeup will stay on my face through the day. I\\u2019m vain enough to want to look my best for my death. The tombs are as grim as their name suggests. Myself, Kiki, and another girl whose name I didn\\u2019t know are taken out of G and marched down the yellow line. I don\\u2019t know the layout of the jail, but it has lots of twists and turns and what seems like different wings. We are taken into a large room where a female guard puts handcuffs on us. This time my hands are cuffed in front, which, while bad, is still better than before. The cuffs are tight and dig into my wrists. Two shackles with a chain connecting them are snapped around my ankles. We are loaded into a van divided into two sections by a metal grate. Kiki tells me that usually the men are in the other section. She\\u2019s disappointed to find it empty after spending so much time on her makeup. Once we\\u2019re in the tombs, a new set of guards takes over. Kiki and the other woman are put in a holding cell under the courthouse and I am put in a separate one. I have no idea where I\\u2019m going or what will happen. The room is all cement except for a sink and toilet\\u2014there is a built-in bench along one side of the room and a clock on the wall that says it\\u2019s 8 a.m. I should be dead. I can\\u2019t pace because of the shackles, so I just sit on the bench and wait, my legs shaking from the detox. I grab the roll of toilet paper and wipe my runny nose awkwardly, grateful again that my handcuffs are in the front this time. There\\u2019s a vent midway up the wall that I can hear voices through. It\\u2019s Kiki and the other woman, but I can\\u2019t make out what they\\u2019re saying. I watch the clock. Nine a.m. Ten a.m. Eleven a.m. Three hours feels like three days. I think this must be how people go crazy. Left alone with their own thoughts and a ticking clock. I start humming the country music songs I\\u2019ve already learned in a day. Anything to keep my mind off where I am. Noon. One. Have they forgotten I\\u2019m in here? I hobble over to the small window in the door and put my face against it. All I can see is a corridor in both directions. No people. The voices in the vent stopped hours ago so I imagine Kiki is back in G already. I go back to the bench and lay on my side, trying to tuck my knees against my chest to keep warm. Every cell of my body hurts. It\\u2019s like a toothache when you don\\u2019t know exactly what tooth it is\\u2014a dull aching and then a deep pain that flares up for no reason and then returns to the relentless throb of ill-defined agony. I am both restless and exhausted. Right before 2 p.m. the door opens, and I quickly sit up. A guard comes in and hands me a paper bag. \\u201cLunch,\\u201d she says. \\u201cDo you know how much longer I\\u2019m going to be in here?\\u201d \\u201cEmergency CPS court works on its own schedule,\\u201d she says cryptically and shuts the door. My heart starts racing. I don\\u2019t know if this means Kaden will be in court. If he sees me, he will want to be with me and I can\\u2019t bear the thought of him thinking I don\\u2019t want to hold him, that I\\u2019m rejecting him in some way. I desperately want to see him and know that he\\u2019s okay. I look in the bag and see a sandwich of some kind and an apple. I have no appetite for food and no energy to wrestle a sandwich out of a bag in handcuffs. I toss it to the end of the bench and start to lie down again when the door opens. \\u201cLove, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d I stumble a little when I stand and shuffle my way to the door. I am led down a hallway to where a male guard stands outside another door. Next to him is DJ. \\u201cUp against the wall,\\u201d the guard says. I stand next to DJ and my mouth is too dry to say anything. He looks just as haggard as me, and really pissed off. \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d he whispers. I shake my head, and my eyes fill with tears. \\u201cNo talking,\\u201d the guard yells. \\u201cThis is my wife,\\u201d DJ growls. \\u201cI don\\u2019t care. No communicating!\\u201d I watch as he and DJ stare each other down. DJ\\u2019s eyes are red-rimmed, and he has two days of stubble on his face. He looks like a different man. Harder. Meaner. Angrier. \\u201cThis is bullshit,\\u201d he mumbles. The guard opens the door and leads us into the courtroom. There is a female judge and I quickly scan the room. No Kaden. No Dylan, Cody, or Ty. Nobody that I recognize. The guard leads us to a row of chairs on the side of the room, where the jury would sit if it were a trial. He makes DJ sit at one end of the row and me at the other. He again tells us no communication of any kind. After the guard walks away, I can see DJ in my peripheral vision trying to get my attention, but despite my many pending felony charges that suggest the contrary, I have always been a rule follower. I keep my eyes down and obey the rule. DJ mutters \\u201cBullshit\\u201d again under his breath, and I can sense the anger coming off him without even looking. I keep my eyes down but shake my head slightly. I want my idiot husband to shut the fuck up. This is family court. We are being judged as parents, and right now the only thing he is conveying is white-privileged asshole with some rage problems. I know I am one green Jolly Rancher away from looking just like the crazy unwashed girl, and all my pencil makeup is gone now, but I quickly try to smooth my hair back, and put on my best PTA-mom face. My neck is sore from the bedsheet knots, and I\\u2019m hoping there are no marks. In front of the judge are two big tables. There\\u2019s a man and woman at one of the tables, and two women at the other. Behind them in the general seats of the court are a handful of people I don\\u2019t recognize. All are in suits of some kind so I figure they must be court people. One man seems to be staring at me intently. The judge reads off a case number and the woman seated next to the man at the table walks up to a little podium in front of the judge. \\u201cIn the matter of Kaden Love Jackson, the minor child, in protective custody\\u2026\\u201d I lean forward, trying to hear what they are saying. \\u201cProtective custody\\u2026 age three years and eleven months\\u2026 emergency foster care\\u2026 multiple serious felony charges\\u2026 trash in house\\u2026 serious neglect\\u2026 left all alone\\u2026 drugs\\u2026 recommend removal.\\u201d A lot of the details she gives are false\\u2014our house was not full of trash, he was not left alone\\u2014but it doesn\\u2019t matter at this point. I am not a good mother simply because I\\u2019m wearing shackles and the uniform of the county jail. The attorney goes on and on about my failures as a mother. There\\u2019s not a mother I know who hasn\\u2019t been mom-shamed in one way or another\\u2014it goes with the territory. This is the Olympics of mom-shaming, though, and I look down at my lap, my cheeks burning. I know I would throw myself in front of a bus to save each one of my boys. I would sacrifice my life for theirs, but I couldn\\u2019t stop using drugs for them. I don\\u2019t know how to reconcile those two truths. The simpler answer is most likely: I am not a good mother. I am a horrible mother. I must love drugs more than I love my children. There\\u2019s no other reason for why I am here\\u2014for why I didn\\u2019t spend the morning making lunches and driving carpool. I deserve to be mom-shamed. DJ starts to yell that it\\u2019s not true and the bailiff threatens to pull him out of the courtroom. I kind of hope they do. It\\u2019s all going so fast I don\\u2019t understand what\\u2019s being decided. Another woman walks up and says she\\u2019s the attorney for the minor child. Kaden has an attorney. \\u201cAnd the other minor children?\\u201d the judge asks, shuffling through paperwork as if she\\u2019s lost something. I hold my breath, not knowing if Dylan, Cody, and Ty were also taken. Or Hailey and Logan. \\u201cThey were not at home when the defendants were arrested and are in the care of a custodial parent so are not subject to CPS proceedings.\\u201d The judge nods and looks up from the file. \\u201cYour Honor, the defendant\\u2019s ex-husband and his wife are currently getting emergency foster care certification and are willing to foster the minor child. We recommend this placement for a minor child with siblings pending a home inspection that is happening this afternoon.\\u201d I lift my head quickly, imploring the judge with my eyes to approve this. A bailiff walks over and hands DJ and me each a manila envelope full of documents. I can\\u2019t open it and look at the papers with my handcuffs, but I sit upright and try to look like a good mother. Finally, the judge looks over at DJ and me. \\u201cThe court is approving the CPS removal of Kaden Love Jackson and orders reunification services pending completion of all the requirements of CPS within one year given the age of the minor child.\\u201d A woman from the other table stands. \\u201cYour Honor, given that the minor child will be four years old in one month and the parents are in custody, we\\u2019d like to ask for the longer time period for reunification services. If we were a month out from here there would be two years to reunify before parenting rights are forfeited.\\u201d \\u201cBut we are not a month out. I\\u2019m afraid the time period is based on the age of the child at time of removal.\\u201d I have no idea what any of this means. My mind is only focused on one thing: Kaden is going to get to be with his brothers, not strangers. He won\\u2019t be afraid. He won\\u2019t be hurt. He won\\u2019t be alone. I take my first full deep breath in two days. When I exhale, it is shaky, and tears start to roll down my face. I quickly try to wipe them away and catch the eye of the man sitting in the back seats still staring at me. He gives me a little nod, but I look away. The bailiff brings over a tissue and I take it gratefully. I wipe my eyes and sneak a look at DJ. I can tell he is not happy that his son is going to be living with my ex-husband. He is glaring at Kaden\\u2019s attorney. I will him with my mind to look at the big picture\\u2014to see why this is such good news. The guard opens the door and waves for us to come out. I look around the courtroom and meet the eyes of the judge. \\u201cThe clock is ticking,\\u201d she says. \\u201cGood luck.\\u201d When we get out in the hallway DJ says, \\u201cThat was fucking bullshit, they can\\u2019t take our son away. Forfeiting parental rights, what the fuck?\\u201d \\u201cNo talking!\\u201d the guard barks. \\u201cThis is good, Kaden will be okay,\\u201d I say. \\u201cBryan will take care of him. He\\u2019ll be with his brothers!\\u201d The female guard brings me to another holding cell and locks me in. I sit on the bench, my manila envelope in my hands, and I stare at the clock. With each pass of the second hand, I feel the pressure building in my chest, behind my eyes, until finally I can\\u2019t hold it any longer. I cry for all the stupid, stupid decisions that got me to this place. I cry for whoever I once was and for who I have now become. I cry because I\\u2019m grateful for Bryan stepping up to save Kaden. I cry because I\\u2019m in handcuffs, and even if I could read the papers that determine my son\\u2019s future, I don\\u2019t want to read them. I can\\u2019t face whatever words are on these pages, so I cry because I\\u2019m a coward. I cry for everything I threw away. I cry because I have never felt so alone and lost. I cry for my four boys and for how thoroughly I have changed the trajectory of their childhoods, of their lives. At home I have pictures of every birthday party, every vacation, every visit to the zoo and the beach and Halloween costumes and Easter egg hunts and Christmas mornings. When somebody once asked me why I kept so many printed pictures I jokingly said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s so when they are adults I can prove to them they had a happy childhood.\\u201d None of those pictures will matter anymore. My arrest changes everything. The future and the past. Mostly I cry because it\\u2019s all my fault. There is no one else to blame. There is no one I hate more in this world than the ugly woman I see in the distorted mirror above the sink in this holding cell. She deserves nothing but pain and punishment. There is nothing the court can do to me worse than what I will do to myself. I don\\u2019t need a trial. I have already judged myself guilty. I have already been sentenced. When I am done crying, I feel wrung out. The front of my shirt is wet with snot and tears, and my whole body shakes. But my mind is finally quiet. There are no more thoughts left to think. There is only the sound of the ticking clock. \\n chapter 7 LOST GIRLS The first time I stole something I was thirteen years old. I had passed my velour tracksuit, Dorothy Hamill\\u2013haircut phase and went straight into my awkward phase\\u2014long Farrah Fawcett\\u2013style flipped bangs, breasts that developed way before I knew how to handle the attention they garnered, and crippling self-consciousness. I was obsessed with clothes, not fashion. I was obsessed with any clothes that weren\\u2019t my clothes. My mom was too busy to shop for me, so she would just give me some of her clothes whenever I begged her to go shopping. I wanted to dress like Brooke Shields in The Blue Lagoon\\u2014flowing beachy-boho white dresses\\u2014but in reality I was dressed more like Dolly Parton in 9 to 5. My mom was into the power suits and shoulder pads of the eighties. My Aunt Jodee was only ten years older than me, and while I was self-consciously peering out at the world from behind my blond bangs, she was a hippie who didn\\u2019t care what people thought of her. She had been living on her own in California since the age of sixteen and although I saw her only once every few years, I worshipped everything about her. I wanted to be her. And I coveted every piece of clothing she owned. Faded denim jeans and lacy tank tops and layered T-shirts with an arm full of bangle bracelets. And so, on one visit to see her I stole her favorite pair of jeans. I grabbed them from a bench in the back of the VW van she was living out of and stuffed them in my suitcase. When she couldn\\u2019t find them the next day and started looking everywhere for them, I helped her look. When I went back to Massachusetts I pulled them out of the bottom of my suitcase and put them on. All the women on my mom\\u2019s side are tiny, so they fit perfectly. Once in a while I would think of her tearing apart her van looking for the jeans, but then I would just put the thought aside. I wore the jeans every single day, along with the white lacy top I had also stolen from her. In them, I felt like I was somebody else, and it was the best feeling in the world. I remember this story while I\\u2019m riding in the van back to G. Maybe I was just born a criminal. Was it in my blood all along\\u2014was I destined to be bad? Could I trace a line from my aunt\\u2019s jeans, to my neighbors\\u2019 mail, to facing twenty-seven years in prison? These thoughts exhaust me. I have missed dinner, but there\\u2019s about ten girls still sitting at the tables when I walk back in. Kiki, Nina, and others whose names I don\\u2019t know. \\u201cVivian thought you got out,\\u201d says Kiki. She nods over to a woman with long brown hair parted in the middle and giant round eyes, the one who had beckoned me over to her door on my first night. Her skin is smooth and so pale against her brown hair it almost looks translucent. She looks like a Breck shampoo girl from the seventies. \\u201cNo,\\u201d I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m not getting out.\\u201d \\u201cYou have Marigonda?\\u201d another woman asks. \\u201cWho?\\u201d \\u201cJudge Marigonda?\\u201d \\u201cNo,\\u201d I say. \\u201cMy judge was a woman, Judge Guy.\\u201d The women all gasp. \\u201cYou had family court in Watsonville?\\u201d \\u201cEmergency CPS court in Santa Cruz.\\u201d The women all exchange looks that I don\\u2019t understand. \\u201cDid you do something to your child?\\u201d The woman who asks this stands up. She\\u2019s short and squat and has a completely buzzed haircut. She looks like what I imagine the Buddha would look like if he were in G. \\u201cDid you hurt a kid?\\u201d She growls this at me. \\u201cDaddy, come on\\u2026\\u201d says Kiki. I don\\u2019t know how to answer this question, and everybody stares quietly at me. I look around the tables. \\u201cWhen I was arrested\\u2026 they took my son, he\\u2019s almost four\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t hurt him\\u2026 they just wouldn\\u2019t let me call someone\\u2026\\u201d I swallow. \\u201cAnd now they\\u2019re saying my charges add up to twenty-seven years in prison.\\u201d My body starts to shiver again, and I hang my head. Let them beat me. I don\\u2019t care anymore. There is silence for a minute and then all the women start talking at once. \\u201cThose fuckers\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cThey just want a case so they can get paid. They wouldn\\u2019t let my mom take Jos\\u00e9 and now he calls a total stranger Mami.\\u201d \\u201cThey have three of mine.\\u201d Nina gets up, walks over, and hugs me. \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you lie down? We\\u2019ll make you a hot water bottle. Little K told us you were detoxing from the shit. You want some ramen?\\u201d I shake my head and let her pull me over to my bunk. I stand there while she straightens the sheet and blanket. She lifts my pillow and I see the letter to my boys underneath, but she ignores it and sets the pillow back on top of it. \\u201cTake off your reds, it will be more comfortable.\\u201d She points to my cover shirt I\\u2019m wearing over my T-shirt and then grabs the manila envelope out of my hand and sets it at the edge of my bed. I pull the shirt off over my head. She folds it and puts it on top of the envelope. \\u201cYou\\u2019re skinny, girl. You\\u2019re going to have to start eating.\\u201d I\\u2019m still shivering when I get into bed. Little K comes over with a plastic soda bottle full of water from the hot pot and tucks it in next to my chest then walks back over to the tables. The warmth feels so good that I just clutch it and stare out at the other women. \\u201cHey, Love,\\u201d says Vivian. \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cHow much time did they give you?\\u201d \\u201cTime for what?\\u201d \\u201cTo reunify\\u2014to get your son back.\\u201d \\u201cOh,\\u201d I say. \\u201cOne year.\\u201d The other women are quiet except for Nina who mutters, \\u201cOh fuck\\u2026\\u201d I lie in bed and watch country music videos until the water bottle cools. Nina comes over to check on me. \\u201cYou know,\\u201d she says, \\u201cI was gang-raped by some guys I thought were my homeboys and got pregnant and my family was so ashamed they kicked me out of the house. I didn\\u2019t have anywhere to live so CPS took my son. That\\u2019s when I started doing the meth. He\\u2019s almost six now.\\u201d Nina doesn\\u2019t look older than twenty-two, and still has the fullness of her own babyhood in her cheeks. \\u201cThat\\u2019s not right,\\u201d I say. \\u201cDid they catch the guys who did it?\\u201d She looks at me funny. \\u201cWhere you from, girl?\\u201d \\u201cAptos.\\u201d Nina laughs. \\u201cHey girls, this one here is reppin\\u2019 Aptos.\\u201d Everybody laughs, but it\\u2019s not a mean laughter, so I laugh also. \\u201cPTA gang,\\u201d I say weakly and then I freeze for a minute, worrying this might be offensive. Nina laughs harder. \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, Aptos, whaaattt!? Fuckin\\u2019 PTA gang, that\\u2019s good.\\u201d I smile. \\u201cLeah over there is six months pregnant. She gets a double pad to sleep on and extra milk.\\u201d Leah waves at me and pats her stomach. I don\\u2019t know where she will have her baby and what will happen after. I don\\u2019t know if they let babies in here. I imagine Kaden in this room with me. I would give anything to snuggle him in this bunk bed. \\u201cNina?\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cWhere do I shower?\\u201d She points over to a curtain next to the main window that has a view of the guard center. \\u201cIn there, but wear your shoes.\\u201d \\u201cHow do I get a towel?\\u201d \\u201cThey didn\\u2019t give you one?\\u201d \\u201cNo, just this.\\u201d I hold up the bag with the toothbrush and comb and tiny pen and disassembled razor. \\u201cYou get a cup and a spork?\\u201d \\u201cWhat\\u2019s a spork?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s like if a spoon and a fork had a baby. Half round with tiny little prongs so you can\\u2019t stab anyone with it.\\u201d I shake my head. She doesn\\u2019t say anything about the razor. \\u201cHey, Daddy,\\u201d she yells. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d \\u201cCO didn\\u2019t give homegirl here any towel, cup, spork, or hygiene.\\u201d Daddy slowly gets up and walks over to the window. She bangs on it a few times and waves the guard in. As soon as the door opens, a few women get up and start dancing to the music. Daddy talks to him for a few minutes, looks over at me, and then back at the guard. I can\\u2019t hear what they are saying. He shrugs and walks out. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s with the dancing?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cThey play it all day for punishment. They have the remote control to the TV out there,\\u201d says Nina, flicking her head toward the guard pavilion thing. \\u201cWe pretend to love it so they don\\u2019t get one up on us, ya know?\\u201d I nod. \\u201cLike they did to the POWs.\\u201d \\u201cSay what?\\u201d \\u201cPrisoners of war. I don\\u2019t know what war, but I remember hearing that music was used as a weapon of torture.\\u201d \\u201cWow,\\u201d says Nina. \\u201cThat sounds right, only we turn it back on them. And besides, it\\u2019s not so bad once you listen to it. These songs got some good stories. At first we faked liking it, but now I think everyone kind of likes it. Don\\u2019t tell the po-po.\\u201d The door opens again, and the guard hands Daddy a bunch of stuff. Nina runs over and takes it out of Daddy\\u2019s arms and brings it over to me. A plastic cup with a spork in it, a travel-size shampoo bottle, another tiny soap, and a scratchy towel. She dumps it all at the end of the bed. \\u201cThanks,\\u201d I say. All of a sudden there\\u2019s a scream from the bunk across from me. It\\u2019s Jolly Rancher Girl looking better than she did yesterday. The shower intervention must have happened while I was at court. \\u201cMy milk is gone, my milk is gone.\\u201d She starts ripping up her bed and looking around the room. \\u201cSomebody stole my milk.\\u201d She runs over to Vivian. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about this\\u2014somebody stole my milk!\\u201d Vivian doesn\\u2019t take her eye off the video for a good minute. The girl just stands there getting more and more agitated and then she runs over to the hot pot and comes back with her cup. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have any milk!\\u201d she screams, slamming the cup down on the table so that black liquid splashes out of the top. Vivian finally looks away from the TV, reaches a hand out, and slides the cup so it\\u2019s in front of her. Then she lifts her T-shirt, pulls out a breast, and squirts milk into the coffee cup. Jolly Rancher Girl grabs the cup and walks back to her bunk. Nina looks at me. \\u201cThey took Vivian\\u2019s baby girl straight from the delivery room.\\u201d She shrugs and then walks away. It\\u2019s almost 8 p.m. now, and I pray Kaden is with his brothers. What if Bryan and Darcy didn\\u2019t get emergency certified? I can\\u2019t take not knowing so I get up from bed and walk over to the pay phone. I don\\u2019t want to talk to my boys, and I desperately want to talk to them. I make a collect call to Bryan\\u2019s house. Dylan answers. I wait for the pause while he accepts the charges. \\u201cD?\\u201d \\u201cMom?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what to say to my seventeen-year-old. It\\u2019s awkward and weird. \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cYeah, are you?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m okay,\\u201d I lie. \\u201cIs Kaden with you?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, he\\u2019s here.\\u201d \\u201cIs he okay?\\u201d \\u201cHe seems fine. He keeps saying he slept in a cat bed. He says you got him lost.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry, D, I\\u2019m so sorry!\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, Mom.\\u201d \\u201cI love you so much, Dylan. Please tell your brothers I love them and give Kaden kisses from me. Please tell him I love him, and I\\u2019ll see him soon. Please tell him it\\u2019s all going to be okay. I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m so, so sorry!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what more to say to him. We have never been so awkward. My firstborn, the child who made me a mother, the love of my life, really. \\u201cI only have a couple of minutes to talk, but I\\u2019m just\\u2026 sorry.\\u201d There is silence on the other end. \\u201cJust take care of yourself, Mom. Just get better.\\u201d \\u201cBye, I love you.\\u201d \\u201cBye,\\u201d he says. After I hang up, I realize he didn\\u2019t say he loved me. I get back into bed. I\\u2019m grateful that no one can call me in jail. It means I only have to speak to people if I call them. There\\u2019s a kind of freedom in that. I won\\u2019t know what\\u2019s happening in the outside world. In here I just need to focus on taking a shower and getting back into bed. Everything is stripped down to the basics. The shower is only a trickle, but the warm water feels good. I\\u2019ve always preferred crying in water\\u2014the ocean, a bathtub, showers\\u2014and as the tears start to come my knees buckle. I sit on the shower floor, the same one that Nina said to make sure I wore my sandals in, but I don\\u2019t care. I curl up in a ball and let the water run over my head like a baptism. I think about the note under my pillow. I think about my plan to hang myself. And then I hear Dylan\\u2019s voice asking me to get better. Fuck. I\\u2019m not going to kill myself. I can\\u2019t imagine how I\\u2019m going to get through what\\u2019s ahead of me, but there\\u2019s no escaping it. I think of Kaden believing I lost him, and about how I only have a year to get him back. And while technically I haven\\u2019t lost my older boys and there\\u2019s no threat hanging over my right to be their mother, I don\\u2019t know if I will ever really get them back. Are they all lost to me? Am I lost to them? In jail, I am surrounded by girls so young their faces could break your heart. Girls who will ask me to explain to them exactly when in your cycle you can get pregnant. Girls who have children, lots of children, but will look at me blankly when I say the word ovulation. Girls who are full of shame because, like Nina, they have been gang-raped, jumped into a gang, beaten up, beaten down. These are the ride-or-die girls. These are the lost girls, the forgotten girls, the girls whose faces wear scars because they picked at them while staying awake for days with their meth dealer boyfriends, their ride-or-die men, who forget them the minute they get locked up, the minute they go down for crimes that aren\\u2019t their own. The hungry girls who think love is a punch to the face, a knife to the neck, a \\u201chold this bag for me and give it to my guy when he comes over and show him some love\\u201d girls. When the doors get kicked in, these girls get locked up. So tough on the outside, but inside they are scared and alone and desperate for things they have no name for. Everyone I\\u2019ve met so far in G is a lost girl\\u2014Kiki, Nina, Jolly Rancher, Vivian, Leah, Spider Girl, even Daddy. I\\u2019m a lost girl, too, but as I climb back into bed and clutch my makeshift hot water bottle I feel just a little bit found. I am pulled out of G for criminal court a few days later, on Monday. I\\u2019ve been given a public defender, Elizabeth, who is very pregnant. I take her extreme pregnancy as a hopeful sign that they think things might get resolved quickly. I spend another full day alone in the tombs for a fifteen-minute court appearance. The assistant district attorney glares at me like I kicked his puppy then smiles at the judge as the case gets a continuance. DJ has his own public defender. I\\u2019m quickly getting the routine of G down: 5 a.m. breakfast, 12 p.m. lunch, 5 p.m. dinner. Every day is one long country music song broken up with intermissions of gray, tasteless mystery food. Saturday is a tuna and egg salad sandwich; that\\u2019s the party meal everyone looks forward to. Otherwise it is a slab of unknown meat between two pieces of white bread. At dinner, the same slab is breaded and served alongside canned vegetables, usually green beans. Breakfast can only be described as scrambled egg soup. The apples that come with lunch are bruised and mealy. Occasionally there\\u2019s an orange, and that is cause for a citrus celebration. There is orange juggling and competitions to see who can peel it in the fewest strips. There is something about the smell of oranges that brings a bit of joy to G. After a couple of weeks, most of my detox symptoms are gone except for the insomnia. I\\u2019ve always been a light sleeper, so being on the freeway means that every hour, if I do happen to fall asleep, I\\u2019m woken up when the guard makes his rounds. It\\u2019s no wonder that the freeway girls are crazy. We also have a front-row seat to everything that happens in G in the middle of the night. And all the guards who make extra rounds. The guards control our visits, our meals, our mail, and our access to commissary, which means paper and pens and stamps to stay in contact with the outside world. They control whether we get soap and shampoo and any sort of comfort item. If you look at any list of the red flags for domestic violence you will find this jail\\u2019s operating manual. Embarrassing or putting you down; looking at you or acting in ways that scare you; controlling who you see, where you go, or what you do; keeping you or discouraging you from seeing your friends or families; taking your money or refusing to give you money for expenses; preventing you from making your own decisions; telling you that you are a bad parent or threatening to harm or take away your children; preventing you from working or attending school; blaming you for the abuse, or acting like it\\u2019s not really happening; destroying your property or threatening to hurt you; intimidating you with guns, knives, or other weapons; pressuring you to have sex when you don\\u2019t want to or do things sexually you\\u2019re not comfortable with. Check. Check. And check. The result is a unit full of traumatized and triggered women. And the guards have no idea just how similar they are to the men that, one way or another, landed these women in G block. There is a small cement courtyard attached to G\\u2014about the size of a racquetball court, and we walk around it like it\\u2019s a track. Some of the girls waiting for transfers to prison are working out in hopes they will get chosen for fire camp. California uses inmates to fight wildfires and gives them two dollars a day. \\u201cIt\\u2019s better than being locked up,\\u201d says Grace, one of the girls already sentenced and waiting for the prison bus to pick her up. \\u201cAnd two dollars is better than no dollars.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to think about going to prison, but if I do I try to imagine myself fighting fires. It does seem better than being locked in a cell. I join the girls walking in circles in the courtyard. I try to do a push-up but my arms are too weak to support me. There is a set of about six steps that lead to nowhere in one corner of the courtyard and because it\\u2019s out of view of the cameras, girls go up to the top step and smoke contraband cigarettes. The cigarettes, like everything illegal in G, arrive in two ways: packed in the vagina of a girl who knew she was getting remanded or tucked inside one of the \\u201cspecial meals\\u201d that come from the kitchen. The kitchen is run by inmates in Blaine Street\\u2014the minimum-security unit for nonviolent offenders who have already been sentenced. It abuts the main jail but isn\\u2019t connected. The girls who work in the kitchen walk on their own over to the main jail, and I realize these were the girls I saw when I was brought into the sally port. Everyone wants to serve their sentence at Blaine Street with its backyard and bathtubs and rooms rather than cells. It also has its own kitchen and a gym. The Blaine Street residents are responsible for working all over the main jail. They clean the lobby, they clean the offices, they cook the food, they prepare the trays, they do the outside landscaping. They have four communal dayrooms each with their own television. They get to control their own remotes. The equivalent men\\u2019s version of Blaine Street is the Rountree Medium Facility. Unlike Blaine, it is a good ten miles or more from the main jail. The nonviolent men are taken to the main jail every morning and they deliver supplies and then serve the meals to each block. They are the inmate trustees, and they wear a special beige uniform that identifies them. If an inmate requests a special diet because of a food allergy or religious preference, these meals are marked with a specific name. And these special meals are the vessels for messages and contraband to and from anywhere in the jail. Drugs wrapped in plastic are sent in the middle of sandwiches with a name attached so the special-meal person knows who to deliver it to. Cigarettes come in this way, as do kites, which are tiny folded-up notes or information for a specific person or the unit in general. An inmate getting his tray in solitary can pass a message to the trustee who can slip it in a special meal going to a unit where that person can hand it to the recipient. It\\u2019s an underground information and commerce system as busy as the internet and more reliable than Amazon. No special-meal person would dare not pass on the information or drugs. It is my fourth week in G when I get my first kite. A quiet vegan girl who battered her boyfriend walks by my table and drops it on my tray. It\\u2019s from DJ and has my initials in tiny letters in the corner. It\\u2019s only a few sentences, telling me he loves me and that he\\u2019s going to get us out of here. He addresses it \\u201cDear Homegirl.\\u201d I read it and flush it down the toilet. The guards do random searches of everyone\\u2019s bunks, and you don\\u2019t want to get caught with a kite. I think about this note all afternoon. It feels weird that he\\u2019s using the term \\u201chomegirl\\u201d considering he\\u2019s been a mortgage broker for most of his adult life, and he grew up in Los Gatos\\u2014a wealthy Silicon Valley suburb. I guess he\\u2019s adapting to his surroundings, but it feels strange and unsettling. Soon, I learn the third way that kites and contraband get in the jail. I am awake one night when the guard comes in to do the 3 a.m. rounds. At first I think I\\u2019m dreaming because I smell McDonald\\u2019s fries. I watch as the guard walks around the freeway and close my eyes when the flashlight passes over me so he doesn\\u2019t know I\\u2019m awake. I track him as he peers in all the door windows of the lower tier and then walks upstairs. He\\u2019s carrying a McDonald\\u2019s bag, so I know I\\u2019m not crazy. I can\\u2019t see him on the upper tier, but I hear a door open and then shut. When he walks downstairs twenty minutes later, the bag is not in his hands. I don\\u2019t know whose room he went to and what was traded, but after a month in jail I know that the guards don\\u2019t give anything for free. Once a week you can leave G block to go to a twelve-step meeting in a small classroom in the jail. I decide to go during my fifth week. I\\u2019m nervous. Not because it\\u2019s a recovery meeting but because I\\u2019m afraid I\\u2019m going to see someone I know. Before my relapse that landed me in jail, I had been in recovery for six years. I met DJ in recovery. I had also volunteered on the Hospitals and Institutions Committee within Santa Cruz County\\u2019s Narcotics Anonymous group. The H&I committee was responsible for recruiting and training people to bring meetings into the jail. I have to weigh my desire to get out of G and away from country music for an hour against my fear of being seen in my reds as a criminal, a relapser, a twelve-step failure, and a cautionary tale. I can\\u2019t listen to another song about backyard barbecues, so I line up with five others to attend the meeting. H block is also a female unit, so twelve-step and religious meetings are the only time the two units mixed. G is a de facto tribe and we felt we were superior to H block. In reality we were exactly the same, but there was competition over which unit was better looking, had more street cred, and had less snitches. I don\\u2019t understand what the competition is about, but it feels exactly like my high school rivalry between Brookline and Newton. Since you couldn\\u2019t tell where one city ended and the other began, it was a silly, pointless rivalry that still felt super important. I line up in my reds with my ID card in my hand and walk the yellow line to the meeting room. The guard unlocks the door and we all pile inside. Two women in street clothes are at the front of the room. I look up and see Cheryl, a friend I knew from recovery. I steel myself and smile and walk up to her. \\u201cHi, Cheryl,\\u201d I say. She seems surprised to see me. \\u201cOh my god, Lara, hi\\u2026\\u201d I make a move to hug her and she jumps back. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not allowed to hug you,\\u201d she says. I know this, of course. I trained her in my home on a Saturday morning while the boys watched cartoons. I served her donuts and coffee at my dining room table. I went over every rule she had to follow to bring meetings into the jail. I feel my face flush in embarrassment. I turn quickly, retreat to the back of the room, and sit down. I am suddenly angry. Angry at Cheryl. Angry at everyone in this room. But mostly I\\u2019m angry at recovery\\u2014the program, the community, the platitudes, the higher power, the false anonymity, and the hollow applause. NA was full of the worst gossips in the world and bored people looking for drama to replace the using. It was a dangerous combination. I spend the rest of the meeting with my eyes closed, litigating every minute I spent in NA and vowing not to go there again twenty-seven years from now when I get out of prison. That would show them. If I hadn\\u2019t voluntarily gone into recovery, I wouldn\\u2019t have met DJ. If I hadn\\u2019t met DJ, I would have never smoked heroin. If I had never smoked heroin, I would never have stolen credit cards. If I had never used a stolen credit card, I would have never been arrested for identity theft. If I had never been arrested, I would never be in jail at this stupid meeting. This loop replays itself in my head during the walk back to G. I don\\u2019t care that my circular logic is flawed. I don\\u2019t care that if I had never gone into recovery and married DJ, I wouldn\\u2019t have Kaden. I\\u2019m angry, and I don\\u2019t know what to do about it other than rerunning this loop. Back in G, there are still two hours before lights out at ten. I pace restlessly around the freeway. I walk to the phones, but I don\\u2019t know who to call. Most of the women are playing a card game I don\\u2019t understand. Others are making spreads in the hot pot, which involves ramen noodles and then a mix of other items squirreled away from meal trays or ordered from the commissary. Hot Cheetos are a favorite addition to spreads. There are a thousand creative ways that one pot of warm water can be used in jail, and every day I marvel at the culinary creativity. Kiki sees me pacing and asks me what\\u2019s wrong. I shrug and wave my arms around me to encompass G, the jail, the universe. She understands. Everyone in G understands. \\u201cGrace left a book when she went to Chowchilla, do you want it?\\u201d \\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. Does it matter?\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t matter. I can\\u2019t think of the last time I read a book. There was never time in mom life to read, and certainly there wasn\\u2019t time in my addict life. I had ordered several parenting books a couple of weeks before I was arrested, but I had ordered them with a stolen credit card. \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll take it, thanks.\\u201d She goes into her room on the top tier and comes back down with a paperback. I am praying it\\u2019s not historical fiction or some kind of heaving-bosoms romance novel. When she hands it to me I read the title: The Power of Now. I don\\u2019t know who Eckhart Tolle is, but I like self-help books, and if there was ever a time and place for a self-help book it\\u2019s now. I thank Kiki and take the book over to my bunk. I open it and read the first line. \\u201cI have little use for the past and rarely think about it\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019m instantly intrigued. If this book says don\\u2019t think about the past, then I\\u2019m all for it. I have just spent the last hour reliving the past. I have spent every night here reliving my arrest. The past is all I think about, except for when I take a break to agonize over the future. I read until lights out, and I read first thing in the morning. I finish the book in twenty-four hours and start reading it again. I want all the things Tolle describes. I want a higher good, I want to end drama, I want to transform suffering, I want to find the space between my thoughts and soothe my pain body. I want enlightenment and peace. I want to be in the now and not in fear and anxiety and regret. I want to end psychological time. I want wholeness. I want to live in truth\\u2014spiritual truth, emotional truth, psychological truth. Give me all the truths. I read The Power of Now over and over, and I strive to live by its advice. Whenever I\\u2019m in fear of the future I take deep, cleansing breaths and remind myself that in this moment I am okay. Tolle says that pain only feeds on pain, not joy, so I try to find joyful moments, things to be grateful for right now. When Thanksgiving comes, I try to be grateful there\\u2019s an ice cream cup on my tray and not focus on the fact that it is the first holiday I have ever spent without my children. The book offers a kind of freedom I have never felt before\\u2014freedom from my restless, worried mind. I\\u2019ve spent my entire life waiting for the next bad thing to happen, and now that it has I remind myself I\\u2019m still here. I\\u2019m surviving. As heavy as life is in jail, I actually feel lighter. The next time I go to court and the prosecuting attorney glares at me, I don\\u2019t lower my eyes. I look at him, and I stay in the power of the now, and I send him love and light. I stay present in the courtroom, and I try to find the life beneath this life, the self that is thinking about itself. In the tombs, I practice deep whole-body breathing and try to meditate to let the endless, useless hours pass after a ten-minute court appearance. Everything is just a continuance. It\\u2019s so hard to be in jail not knowing how long you will be there. It is psychological-time mind fuckery, so I try to ask myself, What would Eckhart do? And then I take a deep breath and try to stop my racing thoughts. Tolle says waiting is just a state of mind that we need to snap out of\\u2014but he\\u2019s never spent time in the tombs. I am sitting in the tombs deep breathing, trying to be joyfully present, when the door opens. I go to stand, grateful to get back to G, but it\\u2019s the guard bringing in another woman. Unlike mine, her uniform is striped, green and white. She walks in and sits on the bench next to me. I have never been in the tombs with another person in my cell. It\\u2019s unsettling. \\u201cHi,\\u201d she says. \\u201cHi.\\u201d She stares at me for a minute, and then pushes her hair back from her face. \\u201cI\\u2019m Gina.\\u201d \\u201cLara,\\u201d I say. She stares straight ahead in silence after that, and I don\\u2019t know what to say. \\u201cHow are you?\\u201d seems too rhetorical and mundane for such a dire moment. After about ten minutes, Gina starts to cry. I grab the roll of toilet paper and hand it to her. \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d I finally ask. It\\u2019s a ridiculous question, but I must say something. \\u201cI killed my daughter. I didn\\u2019t mean to. Oh God, I didn\\u2019t mean to.\\u201d She starts to sob and I am at once shocked and a little scared. Her tears are heart-wrenching, though, and I feel my own eyes well up. \\u201cIt\\u2019ll be okay,\\u201d I say. \\u201cIt\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d She shakes her head at me. \\u201cI miss her so much. I didn\\u2019t mean it. I don\\u2019t even remember doing it.\\u201d I had heard some of the girls in G talking about a woman in O\\u2014the medical unit\\u2014who had killed her three-year-old daughter by smothering her in a hotel room. Gina is the woman from O. As she cries, I realize I\\u2019m not afraid to be in a locked room with a murderer. Her anguish and sorrow are real and relatable. In an instant I am grateful. My children are alive. They are safe. They are with someone who won\\u2019t hurt them. I try to stay present with her as she cries. I send her compassion in my mind. Every few minutes I murmur to her, \\u201cIt will be okay. It will be okay.\\u201d We are two mothers sitting on a bench in shackles. We both know I\\u2019m lying. The truth is great, but sometimes lies are all you have to get you through. Sorry, Eckhart Tolle. \\n chapter 8 MAMA LOVE It\\u2019s safe to say that when you go from husband and wife to codefendants, the romance is over. DJ is angrier and more belligerent every time we go to court. I get it, the tombs are the worst, but he\\u2019s not helping us any by acting exactly like the prosecution is portraying us. DJ and I met in recovery. He got his third DUI before I met him, and his mom had gotten him a high-powered attorney who negotiated five months at the Camp Recovery Center rather than jail. She even moved in a special mattress for him. They say that dating in recovery is like fishing in polluted waters, but when your whole world is recovery, who else are you going to date? My first marriage was over before it really took off. We were young and broke, and I had three boys in less than five years straight out of graduate school. Stressful under the best of circumstances. I was pregnant with Cody during my wedding and Dylan walked me down the aisle. I knew Bryan and I weren\\u2019t right for each other, and I\\u2019m sure he knew it, too, but we didn\\u2019t have the language to discuss it or work through it. I had doubts even before we got married, but it seemed easier to say yes than to break up. When he cheated on me I tried to forgive him, but at the same time I disconnected from him emotionally. I was trying to protect myself from getting hurt and trying desperately to stay with him so our boys would have parents who were together. It was hard to do both things at the same time. He cheated again. And again. I knew that to stay would mean staring out the window night after night, wondering where he was. I knew that to stay would mean giving up on ever being loved. Bryan Love wasn\\u2019t a bad guy. He just didn\\u2019t love me. So I said goodbye to him and moved with two toddlers and a baby into the bottom level of a friend\\u2019s house surrounded by redwoods. We shared custody. I was twenty-eight years old and I was in grief, but every other weekend when the boys went to their dad\\u2019s house, I went out on the town. I started dating a musician. I became the life of the party. I pretended to become the motherfucking happiest woman alive. DJ and I had sat on the lawn of his rehab and talked about white picket fences and how we both wanted a nice, boring life. He had two young children from his first marriage. I had been a single mom for almost a decade at this point. He left the recovery center every day to work as a mortgage broker, and when he was done serving his time at the Camp he would whisk me away on magical weekends to fancy hotels and lake houses. One time I got off work and went home to find he had redecorated my entire bedroom. I had a new comforter and throw pillows and it felt like being taken care of. It felt like a grand gesture. He was over-the-top and he swept me off my feet in a way that I craved. Sure, he had gotten in legal trouble for drinking and driving three times and had cheated on his first wife while in rehab\\u2014but those throw pillows! When I accidentally got pregnant with Kaden, DJ got me a ring, and we eloped to Hawaii. Part of me wished I could experience a marriage ceremony without morning sickness, but I pushed that aside and said \\u201cI do\\u201d under a palm tree with a volcano looming above us. This was going to be the suburban soccer mom life I wanted. All the bad stuff was in our past. We bought a business\\u2014a pet cemetery (of all things), with down payment help from his mother. We bought a home in a cul-de-sac in Aptos. When Kaden was born, our new neighbors brought over meals. Their children became our children\\u2019s best friends. It was perfectly perfect. And when Kaden was two months old, DJ had to go to rehab in New Mexico because he had started smoking heroin. I took care of all my boys and my two stepchildren and ran our business while he was gone. And I was miserable when he came back because I couldn\\u2019t get over the betrayal of him using. I loved fully until someone hurt me, and then I just pretended to love while remaining vigilant for the next bout of pain. I didn\\u2019t have the skill set to work things out. I didn\\u2019t know how to talk something through or express my deepest feelings. My own emotions embarrassed me so I kept them private. Vulnerable wasn\\u2019t a look I was willing to wear. DJ was miserable too. He had his own demons, his own fears, and we just danced around each other, not willing to look below the surface. So we smiled and fronted and pretended it was all exactly what we wanted. He started smoking heroin again in secret. I started taking pills in secret. We both denied it and tried to catch each other in the act. One day I came home from work, and he was waiting at the door with a drug test in his hand. I was outraged that he would suspect me. And angry. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to pee right now.\\u201d \\u201cPee in this cup when you can then,\\u201d he demands, pulling the cup from a store-bought drug-test kit and stomping away. \\u201cYou\\u2019re the one who relapsed and went to rehab, leaving me with a two-month-old, five kids, and a business!\\u201d I throw this at him to see if it makes him back off, but it doesn\\u2019t work. Outwardly I am mad, but inside I am terrified. The pills are my secret and I need them. They give me my suburban superpowers. In my mind, this is better than all the other moms in their workout wear carrying water bottles full of vodka water. Or sitting at the park drinking chardonnay from sippy cups. There\\u2019s more alcohol at a Little League game than at a Super Bowl party. I don\\u2019t drink, so I feel virtuous. My mind races trying to find a way to get out of this pee test. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to take the dog for a walk, and maybe I\\u2019ll pee when I get back.\\u201d I put our dog on his leash, grab a Tupperware container from the kitchen, and hide it under my sweatshirt. It\\u2019s dark outside, and I walk him around the cul-de-sac. Every minute or so he stops and lifts his leg, and when he does I quickly put the container under the stream and catch it. I think this will only take a few minutes, but each leg lift produces such a tiny amount that I have to walk him for over an hour to get enough. Once we\\u2019re back in the house, I hand the dog off to DJ, grab the cup from his hands, and flounce off to the bathroom. I lock the door and then pour the dog\\u2019s urine in the cup. Luckily it\\u2019s still warm. I hide the Tupperware under the sink, open the door, and hand the cup to DJ. He does the test while I stand by self-righteously. The dog tests clean. I say, \\u201cI told you so. How dare you not believe me? You should look in the mirror the next time you want to accuse someone.\\u201d And the strange thing is, in that moment, I believe I am who I\\u2019m pretending to be. It didn\\u2019t cross my mind to say, \\u201cI have a problem and I need help.\\u201d I have never said that sentence out loud to anyone. I graciously accept DJ\\u2019s apology. Today, DJ and I are put in the same van after leaving the tombs. The driver is playing music and ignoring us as we whisper. \\u201cI want to escape,\\u201d he announces. \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to prison. We could drive to Costa Rica.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to go to prison either, but I can\\u2019t imagine us on the run, and I\\u2019m not even sure if you can drive to Costa Rica. I\\u2019ve always been bad at geography. There have been escapes before. There\\u2019s a girl in G who walked away from Blaine Street. She was caught down at the local diner a quarter mile away and now she\\u2019s not allowed to go back to Blaine Street. As far as I know, nobody has ever escaped from the main jail. I glance at the driver and back at DJ and put my finger to my lips. \\u201cI\\u2019ll think about it,\\u201d I whisper. It\\u2019s hard not having an out date\\u2014an official sentence. I envy the girls in G who have hand-drawn calendars, and every night they get to make a big X through the day. It feels like progress. I\\u2019m in purgatory, and for me, there\\u2019s no progress in purgatory. DJ slips me a kite right before we get out of the van. I panic for a moment because the guards pat you down when you return from the tombs. I quickly tuck it in my bra. Hopefully the guard won\\u2019t be too handsy during my search. I\\u2019m furious that DJ has given me the kite directly. It\\u2019s so much safer to write me via sandwich. When I get back to my cell, after a mercifully light pat down, I tuck under the covers and open the note. When I do, a folded-up note within drops onto my sheet. \\u201cHey Homegirl, I love you and miss you so fucking much. Remember that thing I never tried, well I tried it and it was amazing! Here\\u2019s a little early Xmas present. Who always takes care of you???? Open it privately and carefully!!!!\\u201d I read the note over and over, trying to make it mean anything other than what I think it means. That thing he never tried is injecting heroin. I am shocked. DJ is shooting up? In jail? Which means he could only be sharing a needle. My heart races and my mouth waters. I am ravenous for whatever\\u2019s inside this kite-within-a-kite. I am only about six weeks clean, but I am clean. The idea that DJ isn\\u2019t makes me both angry and jealous. Everybody is trying to get high in G. Some are trying to smoke banana peels leftover from breakfast. Others are ripping out pages from the Bible and rolling up coffee grinds to make a caffeine-laced religious blunt because somebody said they heard smoking coffee gets you high. When the med cart comes, one girl on methadone holds it in her mouth and then spits the warm syrupy medicine into three other mouths. One girl didn\\u2019t give her albuterol inhaler back to the nurse and sprayed it on the sink until it dried into a faint powder that she could snort. When somebody sneaks drugs in, she is rushed to the top tier where Daddy and Vivian and Kiki embrace her and shuttle her into a room while Nina keeps lookout. I don\\u2019t feel great clean, but I don\\u2019t particularly feel bad either. I\\u2019m not invited to the top-tier drug parties, and I\\u2019m okay with that. I want to be clean. Or I did. Now I have whatever DJ gave me, and I\\u2019m questioning why I shouldn\\u2019t use in here. If there\\u2019s anywhere that calls for some mental escape, it\\u2019s here. I go into the bathroom and over to the corner where there are no cameras. My hands are shaking as I unwrap the mini kite. Inside is a tiny plastic baggie full of white powder. I assume it is meth. A part of me is sad it\\u2019s not sticky brown heroin that I could pop in my cheek and suck on like a lozenge. I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s a thing, but I can imagine doing that. I flush both kites down the toilet and tuck the baggie in my bra. I don\\u2019t know what to do. I get into my bunk and close my eyes. Back when DJ and I were keeping our drug habits secret from each other, I found three pea-sized baggies just like the one in my bra. I had searched his gym bag while he drove the kids to school and found them inside a sock. Only those baggies had tar heroin in them\\u2014goopy dark brown pebbles. I felt triumphant. While he was driving carpool, I took down a box of dark brown sugar and a saucepan and boiled the sugar so it looked just like the heroin. Then I made three duplicate baggies and tucked them in his sock. I carried the real heroin in my pocket all day\\u2014constantly playing with the baggies like worry beads. Eventually I googled how to smoke heroin and locked myself in my bedroom with a straw and some tinfoil and a lighter. It didn\\u2019t give me the magical rush of Vicodin on an empty stomach, but it made me feel warm. I had given up the pills for the millionth time and swore I would never take them again, so this felt like a good alternative. Easier. Gentler. It gave me a quiet boost of opiate energy, but I had to smoke a lot to feel it. Or maybe I just had to get better at inhaling. I wasn\\u2019t sure if I was really high or just high because I should be but I kissed DJ when he got home from work and made a nice dinner. I don\\u2019t know if he got high from the brown sugar, but he didn\\u2019t mention it. We played our parts. We played each other. We kept our secrets. I can trace that day to all the days in the year that followed. Telling DJ I knew he was doing heroin. Telling him I wanted to smoke it with him. And then it was on. We spent all our money. I went out stealing, both to fund our habit and maintain our suburban charade. DJ bought the drugs, but I was the real criminal, stealing credit cards and going through other people\\u2019s mail looking for money. It was a year of misery and chaos and lying to everyone. Those little baggies made me lose everyone I loved. I get up from my bunk and walk to Vivian\\u2019s room and knock on her open door. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d She raises her eyebrows as I enter. \\u201cI was in the van from court with my husband today.\\u201d She gives me a nod telling me to continue. I look over my shoulder to make sure there\\u2019s no officer in G, and none of the girls are looking. She sees me glance out and gets off her bunk and shuts the door. I pull out the baggie and hold it out to her in my palm. She smiles at me like we\\u2019re best friends. \\u201cTake it.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cTake it, I don\\u2019t want it.\\u201d She looks at me suspiciously. I shrug. \\u201cI\\u2019m trying to stay clean.\\u201d \\u201cI can respect that. What do you want for it?\\u201d I start to say \\u201cnothing,\\u201d but I\\u2019ve learned enough to know this is worse than asking for something. In G, altruism is always suspicious. I don\\u2019t have money on my books yet, although DJ said his mom was going to put some on mine too. I haven\\u2019t been able to order anything from the commissary. \\u201cDo you have paper and an envelope and stamps?\\u201d \\u201cI can hook that up. What else?\\u201d I don\\u2019t really want anything else\\u2014I just want to be able to write my boys and maybe write in general. But I can tell Vivian doesn\\u2019t think this is an even trade yet. \\u201cGive me two bear claws,\\u201d I say. She gives me a big smile and nods. That night in my bunk, I again try to meditate. I take deep breaths. I try to focus on the breath moving through my body. I try to stop my thoughts by asking myself what my next thought will be. I try to be the self behind the self. Metacognition is great and all, but not that easy when half the locked rooms are high on DJ\\u2019s drugs and the party goes on all night long. I pull the blanket over my head and cry\\u2014this is my meditation tonight. The only thing that\\u2019s happened in our court case since our arrest, besides continuances, is that the judge denies a request to reduce our bail. It\\u2019s still $250,000, which seems excessive considering the only violent moment I\\u2019ve ever had in my life was throwing a head of iceberg lettuce at my high school boyfriend when I was sixteen. Needless to say, no one has bailed me out. My mother-in-law could bail me out, but apparently she\\u2019s too angry to consider it. She blames me for DJ\\u2019s crimes. It\\u2019s almost Christmas, and I\\u2019m no closer to knowing my fate than I was on the day I arrived. I try to call Kaden on December 12, his fourth birthday, but there\\u2019s no answer at Bryan\\u2019s house. Some days it feels like there is no outside world. It\\u2019s just three meals a day and music videos. I feel listless and tense. I only have a year, or I lose Kaden forever. A judge will say I\\u2019m no longer his mother, and legally it will be true. It doesn\\u2019t matter where I am. The clock ticks just the same. Unless I can have a certain number of supervised visits with him, stay clean, provide somewhere to live, get a job, go to therapy, take a parenting class\\u2014I will lose him. None of it is hard to do, but all of it is impossible to do from G. I just want to know what\\u2019s going to happen one way or another. The not knowing is the worst. Every day is like that moment when you lean back in a chair and you go just a little too far and have to jerk yourself upright. I\\u2019m not upright, and I haven\\u2019t fallen; I\\u2019m suspended in that space of muted panic. Things get tenser in G as Christmas approaches. Just like on the outside, holidays are triggering and make everyone even edgier. Arguments happen over the hot pot and someone double-dipping her colored pencil directly instead of putting the hot water in her mug. The cleanliness of the shower is another powder keg waiting to blow. The lack of new videos in the rotation have some cursing the country music channel in two languages. Today tension is high because a woman named Elena was brought in last night and Daddy suspects her of ratting out a friend of a friend of Daddy\\u2019s. There\\u2019s something about a motel room, counterfeit money, and a setup. Daddy is raging at Elena, trying to bait her, trying to get her to respond. Elena just ignores Daddy and watches the videos. Daddy\\u2019s rage is escalating. She\\u2019s on the top level yelling down at Elena and getting zero response. I\\u2019m annoyed that the yelling is interrupting the music. Finally, Daddy comes barreling down the stairs, and I lift my head and watch as she slips on the bottom step and falls. Everyone laughs, even her minions. Daddy does not like to be laughed at. I quickly jump up from my chair and stand between Daddy and the tables. Her face is red with embarrassment. Even under her buzz cut, her scalp has turned red. I give her my hand and as I pull her up, I whisper, \\u201cReal power is quiet power.\\u201d She freezes, her head next to mine. \\u201cIf you lose control of yourself, you lose control of them,\\u201d I add. Daddy pulls me into the bathroom and doesn\\u2019t say a word. Everyone stops laughing. \\u201cExplain,\\u201d she commands. \\u201cIf you rage at Elena, you give her power over you. Over your emotions. She becomes stronger than you.\\u201d Daddy nods. \\u201cIf you fight her, you\\u2019ll get pulled out of here, and then you really won\\u2019t have any control.\\u201d I\\u2019m making shit up now. I have no idea what the guards do when there is a real fight. I recall the time I dumped an entire box of cereal onto the middle of the kitchen floor to shock my kids into silence so I could take a business call and not have the client know I was at home with three little boys. \\u201cYou have to create cognitive dissonance\\u2014do the unexpected thing and she\\u2019ll do something different.\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure if this is what cognitive dissonance means, but the words impress Daddy. \\u201cI get it,\\u201d she says. \\u201cDope.\\u201d She turns and walks out of the bathroom. I follow behind her, not sure what she\\u2019s going to do. She walks over to Jolly Rancher, who\\u2019s sitting next to Elena, and motions for her to get up. She sits down next to Elena and doesn\\u2019t say a word, just stares at her. When lunch comes, she doesn\\u2019t eat. She just sits and stares at Elena. And when Elena moves to a different table, Daddy follows her. All afternoon, she sits and stares and never speaks. When the meal trays come for dinner, Daddy is still staring, and Elena is increasingly nervous and uncomfortable. When Daddy doesn\\u2019t eat dinner, everybody in G goes silent. Elena runs to the bathroom and pushes the panic button. Two guards come in. \\u201cRoll me up,\\u201d she says, pulling her things down from her bunk. \\u201cI need to go to another unit.\\u201d The guards know that a girl rolling herself up really means the other inmates are rolling her up. She\\u2019s not wanted. They don\\u2019t argue when someone wants to be rolled up, and they don\\u2019t ask questions. It\\u2019s how you keep peace in the unit, and the guards want zero problems and zero paperwork. They look around to see if anyone is obviously causing trouble for Elena, but nobody says a word. Daddy just watches the television, disinterested. \\u201cRoll it up then,\\u201d one of them says. After Elena leaves, Daddy walks upstairs and starts moving people around. I see bunks being shifted from room to room. Spider, the girl with the neck tattoo, comes downstairs and moves into the room next to Vivian. That girl moves out onto the freeway. I\\u2019m not sure what is happening until Daddy walks up to me. \\u201cGet your stuff.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019m shocked. Is she rolling me up? \\u201cYou\\u2019re moving in with Patricia.\\u201d Patricia is an older gangster woman and super chill. She has a prime room right at the top of the stairs, but mostly keeps to herself. People show her respect because she\\u2019s so old. I grab my few things and Daddy picks up my yoga mat mattress. I can\\u2019t believe I\\u2019m getting a door that shuts. Some quiet. More privacy. I settle my stuff onto my bed and turn to say hi to Patricia. \\u201cWhat you want?\\u201d she asks with a big smile. Before me on her bunk lies a huge array of snacks from the commissary\\u2014chips, candy bars, ramen noodles, bear claws, Jolly Ranchers. The mother lode. I pick up a Snickers and peel back the wrapper. Nothing in my life has tasted as good as this candy bar. Everything changes once I\\u2019m on the top tier. During long conversations, I get to know everyone well. I stand at the railing and look down on the freeway and discuss the latest gossip in G with Daddy. We keep the peace. My thirty-two felony charges give me street cred I don\\u2019t deserve, considering I didn\\u2019t even know the phrase \\u201cstreet cred\\u201d two months ago. But I go along with it. I develop some swagger. I tell the girls how I decoded the algorithm to credit cards\\u2014the pattern of odd and even numbers that are used by each bank\\u2014so I could create working credit card numbers without having to have an actual card. It\\u2019s not that complicated, but they\\u2019re deeply impressed. On paper, it looks like I\\u2019m the scariest person in the county. Since I don\\u2019t know the street world of Santa Cruz, I don\\u2019t know who to fear, defer to, or lord over\\u2014I treat everyone equally. Now that I\\u2019m on the top tier, I quickly come to understand each subgroup, each clique, each gang, and each outsider, and I speak all jail languages. I can be gangster. I can be a Bible thumper. I can be a wise elder. I can do makeup with Kiki and Nina and flirt with the trustees who deliver the meals. I can also talk to the guards in a way that implies I don\\u2019t really belong here by using big words they\\u2019ve never heard of but have to pretend they know so they can save face with an inmate. I also become the unofficial welcome wagon, making sure that everyone who comes into G has what they are allowed to have. If someone is missing their hygiene kit or a towel like I was, I bang on the window and demand the guard go get it. I am a friend to everyone but not too close with anyone. It\\u2019s exactly as it was in high school. I become whoever I need to be to survive. But mostly I\\u2019m a mom with nowhere to put my mother energy, so I listen. Empathize. Word gets around that I have a master\\u2019s degree so girls who\\u2019ve dropped out of high school start coming to me for advice. Problems are brought to me. Legal issues. I\\u2019m given a nickname. Mama Love. And like any good mother, I lead with compassion. But all it takes is one stern look to bring the miscreants in line. Eventually Daddy brings me her court and legal papers and we talk over options and prison. The minute the unit sees Daddy deferring to me, a peaceful transition of power happens. It\\u2019s subtle and unspoken but real. When someone has a problem with being disrespected by someone, wants to move off the freeway, wants to move upstairs, wants to make a commissary trade, wants to roll someone up, I\\u2019m consulted. Daddy is there, too, but my opinion is always the final word. I write a one-page narrative poem about the girls in G being hooked on H and they make me read it out loud over and over. They have never been written about, their lives and struggles never put on paper. When they learn that a short story of mine has been published in a real book, I hear them telling their family about me on their phone calls. I don\\u2019t tell them that a short story in a small press anthology doesn\\u2019t make you famous or that right now is the first time I\\u2019ve written anything in ten years. But now that I\\u2019m on the top level I have endless paper, so I start to write. I start a young adult novel about angel guides who fall into forbidden love as the two teens they are guiding also fall in love. I mail the first eleven pages to Ty and ask him if he wants to write the book with me. He\\u2019s an avid reader and at thirteen has already written his first novel. He writes in the way people do who are madly in love with language\\u2014a maximalist who will go on to major in linguistics and speak five languages. I tell myself that his love of reading isn\\u2019t for the same reason I loved to read as a kid. I tell myself he isn\\u2019t trying to escape trauma, but it\\u2019s hard to do that when I\\u2019m telling myself that in jail. I write letters to my boys and ask them to read parts to Kaden for me. It\\u2019s hard to talk to them on the phone some days because it\\u2019s awkward and they are teenagers who don\\u2019t love to talk on the phone to begin with. When they put Kaden on, he just tells me he loves his brothers but wants to come home. \\u201cSoon,\\u201d I promise. \\u201cI love you so much,\\u201d I say. The \\u201creal power is quiet power\\u201d mantra spreads through the unit, and people stop fighting so much and instead try to \\u201cout-quiet\\u201d each other. Power doesn\\u2019t have anything to prove, I remind them. None of them know that I actually feel more lost and powerless than ever. My future is in limbo and there\\u2019s no power in limbo. \\n chapter 9 NEW YEAR, NEW YOU It\\u2019s a year of firsts without my children. My first Thanksgiving without them. My first Christmas without them. I miss Kaden\\u2019s fourth birthday on December 12, and Cody\\u2019s sixteenth birthday on December 30. I am now someone who misses her children\\u2019s birthdays because she\\u2019s in jail. Shortly after Thanksgiving, Darcy sends me a Christmas card that shows her and my four boys. They are making a pyramid at the beach, and they are all in Santa hats. I think I know why she sends me this picture, and it is not to wish me season\\u2019s greetings. I try to focus on the fact that they\\u2019re all together, and safe. While Bryan was not the best husband, he is a great dad. Darcy couldn\\u2019t have children, and while we were friendly as she got together with Bryan, things have been fraught this last year during my relapse. Darcy hired an expensive lawyer, and Bryan took me to court over custody. They wanted more time with them and accused me of being on drugs. They were right, of course, but I still denied it. I wanted to pretend I was fine and work things out with Bryan without lawyers or courts the way we always had. I didn\\u2019t think it was any of Darcy\\u2019s business, and I was afraid that if I had gone to them and said, \\u201cHey, can you take the boys for thirty days so I can go to rehab and get my shit together?\\u201d they would have used that against me in court. I was stuck. In jail, I choose not to think about the fact that my boys had said they didn\\u2019t like Darcy. By their account: She screamed at them all the time. The house was never clean enough for her taste. She often hid out in her room. She got mad at them for eating her special food. She was always yelling at and fighting with their dad. Maybe it was true or maybe it was just kids complaining. Darcy and I had long pretended to get along for the boys, but I always felt like she resented me when I did well and celebrated when I did badly. Underneath the pretense was the simple fact that, no matter what, I was always going to be the mother and she was always going to be the stepmother. She could never change that or, perhaps, forgive me for that. After months of dragged-out mediation over custody, my arrest had settled it once and for all. I knew Bryan would take care of Kaden and love him while I was in jail. I knew Kaden would be happy as long as he was around his big brothers. Darcy was a necessary evil, but better than strangers. I sent her as much love and light as I could. I hoped her heart would be open to Kaden. I was grateful to her and wary of her at the same time. Now she holds my baby in this picture, and it feels like she is staring straight into my soul. Now she has all my children all the time. She has won. I push thoughts of Darcy away and try to stay in the moment. Jail is a great place to learn to meditate, and it\\u2019s going to be my New Year\\u2019s resolution. I sit on my bunk breathing every day of December\\u2014first for five minutes, then ten, then thirty, until I can meditate for an hour without feeling like more than five minutes have passed. It\\u2019s a way to beat crazy jail time at its own game. After an hour of meditation there\\u2019s a feeling that\\u2019s almost like getting high. Not quite, but close. I wish I knew how many hours of meditation would equal twenty Vicodin. When people speak to me, I practice being present and sending them love. I do this with the guards, with the judge and prosecutor when my case is continued yet again on Christmas Eve, with Daddy and Nina and Kiki and Vivian. I send love to the scared women who come in for their first time. I also make sure to tell them how everything works in G. I give them the orientation I never got. All day long I send love out to the world. To my children. My neighbors in Aptos. To DJ and Bryan. I even send love to Darcy, but then I think of her clutching Kaden and I take it back. I\\u2019m not the Dalai Lama, after all. The other women tell me that I will definitely be going to prison and that I should start working out now so I can try out for fire camp. We go in the courtyard and do sit-ups and push-ups and walk in endless circles. No one can figure out how many times around the small courtyard is a mile. The guesses range from fifty to a thousand. On Christmas morning I wake up and walk around the courtyard for hours. I meditate as I walk. I meditate all day long so I don\\u2019t have to think about life outside G block. The time between Christmas and New Year\\u2019s is extra boring, so Daddy and I hatch a plan to break up the monotony. Leah, who is pregnant, will fake labor pains. She\\u2019s only seven months, so Daddy has determined that this will be too serious for normal medical and as a holiday gift to us, she will get paramedics into the unit for our viewing pleasure and just to break up the monotony. She and Leah come into my cell as they are plotting the details. \\u201cI need to know what labor feels like,\\u201d says Leah. \\u201cYou have a million children, coach me.\\u201d I have nothing better to do so I agree. \\u201cDo you get period cramps?\\u201d \\u201cYeah,\\u201d says Leah. \\u201cIt\\u2019s nothing like that,\\u201d I say. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like this pressure that builds, kind of from the back, and then it wraps around and tightens.\\u201d I think back to all my labors with Dylan, Cody, Ty, and Kaden. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like no other pain there is when it comes. A tightness and a squeezing and sometimes the pain is so bad it takes your breath away.\\u201d I know this is pretend, but I see in Leah\\u2019s face the realization of what awaits her when she has her baby. She looks scared. I am about to say it\\u2019s okay because it\\u2019s all worth it, and you have this beautiful baby, and you fall in love like you\\u2019ve never felt love before, but I stop myself. Her baby will be taken away from her in the hospital. She will give birth handcuffed to a bed. She will fall in love and have her heart broken at the same moment. Everyone is excited to start the New Year with visions of paramedics. Daddy pushes the panic button and calls the guards. \\u201cLeah is going into labor. She\\u2019s in pain, come quick!\\u201d she yells. Leah has taken over an empty bunk on the freeway, so everyone can witness the performance. Two guards rush in and hover over her. \\u201cOohhhh it hurts, it hurts\\u2026\\u201d she moans. They try to get her up, but she screams louder and says she can\\u2019t move. Her performance is high-school-theater level, but it convinces the guards. One talks into his shoulder radio and instructs someone to call 911. It only takes about ten minutes for the paramedics to arrive. Firefighters also. There are four of them, and they are young and gorgeous. The guards lock everyone in the cells, but we watch through the windows as they stand around Leah. Within minutes two more paramedics come in with a gurney. We watch in disbelief as Leah is wheeled out of G. Right before she\\u2019s rolled out the door, she flips us all the bird. The guards unlock the cells, and Daddy asks where they are taking her. \\u201cDominican Hospital,\\u201d one of the guards says. As soon as he leaves the room, there\\u2019s a mad rush to the phones. Three girls call their drug dealers and tell them to get to Dominican Hospital emergency. Leah is on the outside and will be coming back in once they realize she\\u2019s not in labor. This wasn\\u2019t the plan, and I feel my power in G slip a little. Did Daddy keep this part of the plan from me? It\\u2019s no secret that I don\\u2019t use the drugs DJ sends me. I don\\u2019t know if this was the real plan all along and Daddy says no when I ask. I\\u2019m not thrilled at the idea of more drugs in G, but I could never say that. It\\u2019s so hard to stay clean in G and I\\u2019m almost at sixty days. I\\u2019m proud of myself, but when they are around, the cravings are stronger than my meditation. In recovery they always say, \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t want a haircut, then don\\u2019t hang out at a barber shop.\\u201d There\\u2019s no catchy platitude for when you\\u2019re locked in the barber shop twenty-four hours a day. Leah doesn\\u2019t come back before lockdown, so I go to sleep not knowing if she was met by a cavalcade of drug dealers in the ER. I am awoken by yelling. Patricia and I jump up. I slept in my clothes, but she is in her bra and underwear only. There are about ten guards in G shouting, all the doors are open, and the lights are on. \\u201cEveryone out on the floor, now!\\u201d they scream. Girls are running down the stairs. Patricia tries to grab her clothes, but the guard yells at her not to touch anything. There\\u2019s yelling from Daddy\\u2019s room, but I don\\u2019t have a chance to turn back before we are all rushed out of G block. Shakedowns have happened before but there\\u2019s usually some warning and people have time to hide their second mattress in the shower or tuck any contraband away in hidey-holes around the unit. Not tonight. The entire unit is marched through the jail until we get to the big holding room you pass through before you go to court. There\\u2019s a giant wire cage in one corner of the room. It\\u2019s square and looks like the temporary fencing that goes up around construction sites. We\\u2019re all herded into the cage and stand there stunned as it\\u2019s locked from the outside with a giant padlock. I look around at some of the regulars to see if this is normal, and I can tell this is not normal for anyone. I don\\u2019t see Leah; she must still be at the hospital. I think about all the calls made to drug dealers. I had heard girls talking about the trick we played on the guards over the phone. After a while it\\u2019s easy to forget that the guards are always listening to everything. It is freezing in the cage, and poor Patricia is half-naked and shivering. \\u201cHey,\\u201d I yell to one of the guards. \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cCan you get her some clothes? She\\u2019s freezing.\\u201d I nod toward Patricia. \\u201cYeah, sure, no problem.\\u201d Thank God for small kindnesses. I give her a big fake smile and say, \\u201cThanks so much! Hey, do you happen to know what time it is?\\u201d \\u201cWhy? You have somewhere to be?\\u201d She laughs and walks away. I\\u2019m guessing it\\u2019s 2 a.m., maybe three. Girls are huddled together on the floor trying to fall back asleep. Daddy and Kiki and Vivian are whispering. I need to see what\\u2019s up with them, but first I need to get Patricia dressed. The guard brings her some reds and a big beige coat. \\u201cWhoa,\\u201d I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen one of those before.\\u201d \\u201cBlaine Street coat,\\u201d says Patricia. \\u201cSo they don\\u2019t get cold walking over to the kitchen.\\u201d It\\u2019s a huge coat, with thick canvas material on the outside and soft flannel inside. It\\u2019s warm. It\\u2019s luxurious. It\\u2019s amazing. We\\u2019re left in the cage for hours. Daddy is pissed because she has a lighter in her cell and doesn\\u2019t want to get another demerit. The more demerits you get, the less credit you have to shave days or even weeks off your sentence. We sit in there through what would normally be breakfast time, and it\\u2019s almost light out when they bring us back right before the shift change at 7 a.m. The guards don\\u2019t say a word as they march us back to G. None of us have any idea what they were looking for or what they may have found. G is in shambles. The freeway mattresses are scattered all over the floor, and everything from the cells has been dumped haphazardly along the tier: books, letters, legal papers, blankets, clothes, toothbrushes. Family pictures painstakingly glued on the walls with toothpaste have been ripped down. Shelves engineered from empty maxi pad boxes have been crushed. Commissary items are scattered. It\\u2019s like a Category 5 hurricane hit G. This wasn\\u2019t an investigation\\u2014it was punishment. We\\u2019re all trying to sort whose belongings are whose when Leah comes back in with a big smile on her face. I can\\u2019t deal with all of this and the temptation of drugs at the same time. I assume that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s smiling about. I quickly get on the pay phone to call my boys. If anything will strengthen my resolve it will be talking to them. Because DJ always has money on his books I use his S-number whenever I need to make a call. The system will charge his account. I dial his S-number and the operator says it\\u2019s not valid. I think I must have done it wrong so I try again. I keep trying. If there wasn\\u2019t money, it would say not enough money and to call collect. I have never heard the not-a-valid-number message. This is not possible. I run to my room and pick up one of his letters from the floor and look at the number on the envelope. I don\\u2019t have the number wrong. I try to call again as panic sets in. My mind starts to conjure all sorts of disaster scenarios. He\\u2019s overdosed and in the morgue. He\\u2019s been shanked and is in the morgue. He\\u2019s been taken off to prison now even though we haven\\u2019t even had a trial or been sentenced. My hands are shaking. I don\\u2019t know what to do. I have no money on my books to make a call. I call my mom collect. No answer. I don\\u2019t want to call my mother-in-law. I\\u2019ve tried to avoid her because I\\u2019m pretty sure she hates me and it\\u2019s just too much to deal with. I pace nervously around G, not sure what to do after the mess is cleaned up. I keep trying to use his S-number. Maybe the jail found out I was using it for my calls and shut it down. Maybe that\\u2019s what the not-valid number means. Maybe this is more punishment. G block is excitedly listening to Leah\\u2019s account of the ambulance ride and the real ice cream they gave her in the hospital. No drugs got through because they took her to the maternity ward rather than the ER. \\u201cBraxton Hicks,\\u201d she yells at me as I stand at the bank of phones. \\u201cYou forgot to tell me about Braxton Hicks contractions.\\u201d I shrug. I\\u2019m just glad there are no drugs to tempt me. I gather my courage and make a collect call to my mother-in-law. I wait for it to connect, and I hear her accept the charges. There\\u2019s a shuffling and cracking sound as if the phone has been dropped, and then I hear a man\\u2019s voice: \\u201cHello?\\u201d \\u201cHello?\\u201d DJ says again. \\u201cHello?\\u201d I whisper. There is a long pause, and I feel as if G block just flipped sideways. I press my hand against the wall to steady myself. \\u201cI got bailed out,\\u201d he says. \\u201cYou mean your mom bailed you out\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cYeah.\\u201d He\\u2019s trying to keep the glee out of his voice, but I hear it. He is sleeping in a soft bed and eating good food and taking hot showers. He\\u2019s been getting high all the time while I fight to stay clean, and he is free. I want to scream. I want to cry. But I swallow it all and try not to choke as it goes down. \\u201cAmazing,\\u201d I say. \\u201cLook, baby, I\\u2019m going to get you out of there, I promise. We\\u2019ll be together soon.\\u201d \\u201cWhen did you get out?\\u201d \\u201cA few days ago.\\u201d \\u201cHave you talked to Kaden?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t answer right away, and then he\\u2019s angry. \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to call that fucking house!\\u201d \\u201cHave you not talked to him since we were arrested?\\u201d I am shocked. I never asked, but I assumed he was trying to call and talk to him as much as I was. \\u201cYou didn\\u2019t call him on his birthday?\\u201d I can hear DJ inhale deeply, and I realize he\\u2019s smoking. \\u201cLook, I have to go, we\\u2019re about to go to lunch.\\u201d \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t want to keep you from lunching.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s not like that, I need to do what my mom says, you know how it is\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cOkay. Can you at least put some money on my books so I can call the boys?\\u201d I realize that he\\u2019s been out for a few days and hasn\\u2019t done this yet. I know what he\\u2019s doing with any money he has. \\u201cOf course, and I\\u2019m going to get you out. Who always takes care of you? I will sell everything we have.\\u201d I doubt we have anything left to sell, but I don\\u2019t argue. \\u201cCall me tonight,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWait,\\u201d I say before he hangs up. \\u201cYou need to call CPS! You can do supervised visits. You can take the parenting class. You can start all the requirements. You need to right away or we\\u2019ll lose Kaden!\\u201d \\u201cGotta go. I love you, homegirl.\\u201d I hang up and head back to my room. I imagine DJ free and me in prison for years. I vow never to call him again. When I get back to my cell, Patricia has everything in order. She still has the coat, and it\\u2019s laid across her bed like a comforter. \\u201cLook what I found,\\u201d she says, a huge smile on her face. She\\u2019s holding a small radio. \\u201cHow the hell did you get that?\\u201d \\u201cIt was on the floor outside the cage. When we left, I scooped it up and hid it in my nice big jacket.\\u201d She adjusts the antenna, turns the dial, and gets a local pop station. And when Beyonc\\u00e9\\u2019s \\u201cSingle Ladies\\u201d comes on, Patricia turns the volume all the way up and moves the radio to the doorway. Everyone stops cleaning up the mess and starts to sing. I don\\u2019t think about DJ anymore. I don\\u2019t think about my boys. Just for tonight, G block is the only family I know. The only family I want to know. I smile and shimmy until lights out. That night Patricia is snoring, and I stare up at the darkness wide awake. I\\u2019ve never been able to lie to myself between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.\\u2014those hours have always been when my conscience wakes me up with the truth\\u2014since I first stole my aunt\\u2019s jeans. I\\u2019m too exhausted to use any of my Tolle tricks, so I lie in the dark and let every worry and fear and regret and pain settle in. I press play on my life and watch all my mistakes flicker past my mind\\u2019s eye. I see my fake smiles and my posturing and my decades of pretending everything is okay when it isn\\u2019t. I see all the lies I have told, all the untruths, all the omissions. I see every bottle of Vicodin I have stolen. I see every credit card I have taken. I see everyone I have hurt\\u2014my boys, DJ, Bryan, Darcy, my mom, my neighbors, my friends. I see every ridiculous story I have told to hide my addiction. I see all the moments, years really, where I could have easily asked for help but my ego, my denial, and my shame prevented me. The thought that I was already in jail before I was in jail floats around in my mind, but it\\u2019s both too ephemeral and too complicated for me to unpack. I try to look at my life as if it\\u2019s a story and trace the plot that has gotten me to this bleak place, but there are too many missing pieces. I want to blame some moment for my addiction, some trauma, some loss. But mostly I want to blame somebody. Someone has to be responsible for who I have become, so I put the people in a lineup and try to pick out the perpetrator. My older sister was killed in a car accident. My brother died of a heroin overdose. My other brother had mental health issues and a gambling problem and often threatened suicide. I never had a father. I never had a mother who was present. I never had a normal family. My first husband cheated on me. My second husband is an addict who just abandoned me in jail. I don\\u2019t know the language of grief or loss or emotions at all\\u2014it was never spoken in my home. I can\\u2019t remember a single time in my life when someone asked me \\u201cHow are you?\\u201d and I answered honestly. I don\\u2019t think I have ever known how I am, or who I am. I have always felt like an actor playing the role of me. My whole life I had pretended to be a beautiful, happy, shiny person in the hopes that would somehow make me a beautiful, happy, shiny person. I fit in everywhere because people love beautiful, happy, shiny people. But the problem with me trying to fit in everywhere is that I have never actually felt like I belonged anywhere. Or with anyone. I couldn\\u2019t reach out for help before the police came knocking on my door because I was so desperately playing the suburban mom role I\\u2019d created. This is how a real mom shows up to school board meetings. This is what a real mom makes for snacks. This is how a real mom should sacrifice herself for her children. I vowed to be the mom I never had, but she and I turned out to be just the same. Absent. Gone. If my children need me tonight they can\\u2019t call me. I wonder if showing up as a fake version of yourself is just as bad as not showing up at all? I run this idea around in my mind, poking and prodding at it to see if it holds up. It doesn\\u2019t. The truth is, I would have preferred any version of my mom to being alone. So I am actually worse than my mom. I can study the people in my lineup and make them turn right and then left, but every time I try to point my finger at someone or something, I can\\u2019t. There is no one to blame but me. \\n chapter 10 ROLL IT UP Our public defenders are trying to work out a plea deal. Elizabeth comes to see me, and she is not happy that DJ is out, but super happy that I am still in. \\u201cYou\\u2019re safer in here,\\u201d she says. \\u201cReally? It doesn\\u2019t seem all that safe.\\u201d \\u201cIf you were to get out and commit a crime, do drugs and get caught, the plea deal doesn\\u2019t happen. You will go to prison. I won\\u2019t be able to do anything.\\u201d \\u201cDo you know how many drugs are in this jail? I haven\\u2019t done any, and I could have. A lot.\\u201d She gives me a weak smile, but I want applause. I need some kind of validation. If I said that in a recovery meeting, I\\u2019d get a standing ovation. It\\u2019s the one thing I miss about twelve-step programs. They applaud anything as long as you don\\u2019t use. You can burn your house down in a fit of rage but as long as you don\\u2019t pick up, you\\u2019re a hero. \\u201cDo you think we\\u2019ll get a plea deal?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m trying, but the DA is going at this hard. Probation too. They really, really don\\u2019t like you. Your husband also, but they seem overly focused on you.\\u201d \\u201cBut not the actual DA, right? It\\u2019s the assistant DA?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s all the same. But it\\u2019s the ADA and the head of Probation. They want prison. If you weren\\u2019t a white woman, you\\u2019d get prison for sure.\\u201d I nod because it\\u2019s true. Mimi, a Latina in G, just got sentenced to four years for embezzlement: using her company credit card for personal expenses\\u2014more or less the same crime that put me in G block. Everything in her case happened ridiculously fast. Arrest, sentencing, and onto the prison bus in less than a month. Mimi has two children she\\u2019s raising on her own. She supports her parents and grandparents too. When she left, she said she\\u2019d see me in Chowchilla. She assured me that prison is much better than jail\\u2014easier. She had family members in prison, she said, so she knew what to expect. You get more visits, you get classes and workshops, you can work and stay busy. \\u201cDoes the DA look at all the cases?\\u201d I ask Elizabeth. \\u201cLike does he know about them?\\u201d \\u201cOf course.\\u201d It\\u2019s probably not helping my case that I once dated the current district attorney, and by dated I mean had a torrid affair with him while he was living with another woman. It was 1989, and I was in my last year of college and working as a manager at Player\\u2019s Pizza\\u2014a sports bar and grill around the corner from the courthouse. He would come in after work, alone or with coworkers. He was tall and blond and while he introduced himself as Tom, I immediately renamed him Sven because he looked like a Nordic god. I flirted with him shamelessly, and he began to stay at Player\\u2019s until closing time, waiting for me to get off work so we could spend time together. Sometimes he would take me into the courthouse after hours and make love to me in all the offices, even once in what he called the gun room. Gun rooms are sexy, and I don\\u2019t even like guns. He would spend hours at my small studio apartment, letting me read through his confidential case files and discussing strategy. He was a new assistant district attorney then, a decade older than me, and I was about to go off to graduate school. When I moved back to Santa Cruz after Dylan was born, we reconnected as friends, and I would sometimes visit him in his offices at the courthouse, where, knowing my writerly curiosity, he would tell me about cases he was working on and let me listen to 911 calls. He had never lost a trial, a fact he was very proud of. He was also bitter about his first marriage ending and shared how hard the divorce was and how upset he was about the claim she had made on his pension. When Tom ran for district attorney in 2002 on a family-values, law-and-order platform, I had to laugh. There were definitely no family values happening in the gun room, but that felt like a lifetime ago. Our friendship petered out as life went on, and now was impossible given that he was technically prosecuting me. It couldn\\u2019t help my case that his new wife was high up in the probation department. I didn\\u2019t know if she was aware of my history with her husband, but when Elizabeth says that Probation is taking a hard line on my case, I have to consider it a possibility. On one of our early court appearances, I saw him off to the side in a huddle with other attorneys, and I wondered if they were talking about me or one of the dozens of other cases before the court that day. I was too ashamed to meet his eye, and I imagine he wasn\\u2019t eager to acknowledge me either. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to keep at it,\\u201d Elizabeth assures me. She puts a hand on her belly again. \\u201cHow\\u2019s your son?\\u201d She used to be a CPS attorney before becoming a public defender. \\u201cHe\\u2019s good. He just turned four. I talk to him when I can, but it\\u2019s so hard\\u2026 he doesn\\u2019t understand why I\\u2019m not with him.\\u201d I tear up. \\u201cHang in there,\\u201d she says kindly. When I get back the unit is in a tizzy. Rooms are getting switched, and when I ask Daddy what\\u2019s going on, she says that they got word Princess was in booking. \\u201cWho\\u2019s Princess?\\u201d Daddy looks at me like I\\u2019m crazy. At times like these my position in G feels tenuous. I don\\u2019t know the players on the streets. I know there are girls everyone is afraid will come into G, and other girls they wish would come in. Apparently Princess is a big-time meth dealer\\u2014the original lady boss\\u2014competing in a man\\u2019s world and making a killing. Patricia and I are split up, and I move into a room with Kiki. It\\u2019s the last room on the top tier. A corner room, so it\\u2019s the biggest. Daddy is next door. Patricia moves to the bottom tier. I\\u2019m happy to move in with Kiki. She\\u2019s smart and funny and tough and sweet. She\\u2019s barely older than Dylan so I feel most like Mama Love around her. I\\u2019m anxious that Princess\\u2019s arrival will mean more drugs in G. It\\u2019s almost rude of me not to do drugs that are offered, but I really don\\u2019t want to. I\\u2019m working on my YA novel and mailing pages to Ty to type up. My mind seems full of creative ideas. I jot down notes for short story ideas. I long for a keyboard. In prison I would have access to a computer. It\\u2019s the only upside of prison I can think of. When Princess arrives, Vivian and Daddy rush her upstairs. She doesn\\u2019t look like a drug dealer: She\\u2019s tiny with long strawberry-blond hair, pale eyes, and freckles on her face and arms. I\\u2019m obligated to meet her, and when Daddy introduces me, she just flicks her eyes in my direction and ignores me. I leave their huddle in Daddy\\u2019s room and lie down on my bunk. I don\\u2019t want to see what she brought in. That night Kiki gets permission from one of the guards\\u2014the one who brought in the McDonald\\u2019s\\u2014to spend the night in Daddy\\u2019s room. She asks for a sleepover, and he laughs and says okay. I can hear them through the wall all night long. It\\u2019s a meth party for sure. And when the moaning starts, I recall Kiki telling me that when she does meth she just wants to watch porn and fuck. My meditation is no match for the threesome next door, so I just stare into the darkness. I think about my boys asleep just a few miles away and wonder what they are dreaming about. I send them love and light and sweet dreams. I hum their favorite made-up lullaby: \\u201cMommy loves you, yes she does, Mommy loves you just because\\u2026\\u201d Dylan, Cody, and Ty are too old for lullabies, but I sing it to them anyway. I imagine myself scratching Kaden\\u2019s arm so he can fall asleep. I hum all night long until the lights come on for breakfast. Kiki doesn\\u2019t eat breakfast. Neither does Daddy, Vivian, or Princess. They divide their meals among the other girls when the guards aren\\u2019t looking. If a group of inmates stops eating, it\\u2019s a sure sign there\\u2019s meth in the unit. The meth bender lasts for three days until the drugs run out. Nobody in the unit sleeps. It\\u2019s a G-block rave, and the guards don\\u2019t say a word. Everyone but me from the top tier is in a sleepover cell. Eleven girls crammed into two rooms. The guards even unlock the doors so the girls can go downstairs and get hot water from the hot pot for commissary cocoa. They must know there\\u2019s meth, but there are no searches. Kiki is back in my room, and she\\u2019s exhausted. She looks like she\\u2019s lost ten pounds in three days, but I don\\u2019t comment. It\\u2019s commissary night and because my mom had put twenty dollars on my books I receive a batch of chocolate and ramen and new sandals. It feels like Christmas, and the unit is busy comparing hauls and making trades like my kids do with Pok\\u00e9mon cards. Suddenly, the intercom in our room crackles. Kiki and I freeze. \\u201cLove, roll it up!\\u201d I look at Kiki and she looks at me. \\u201cWhat did he say?\\u201d I ask in disbelief. \\u201cHe told you to roll it up,\\u201d she whispers. I walk over and press the intercom button. \\u201cYeah.\\u201d It\\u2019s the same guard. \\u201cWhat did you just say?\\u201d \\u201cI said, \\u2018roll it up.\\u2019 \\u201d \\u201cWhy, what did I do?\\u201d \\u201cYou made bail; roll it up. You got five minutes.\\u201d Kiki and I look at each other in silence, and then she screams. She runs into the hallway and announces, \\u201cMama Love\\u2019s getting bailed out!\\u201d Daddy and Vivian run out and congratulate me. I hand them my commissary food and give Kiki my new shoes. I grab all my legal papers and letters. It\\u2019s not much, but I look around the cell frantically. I hand Eckhart Tolle to Kiki. \\u201cRead it,\\u201d I say. She laughs. \\u201cI hate to read!\\u201d \\u201cRead it anyway,\\u201d I say. \\u201cTrust me.\\u201d Kiki folds up my mattress, and Vivian grabs my blanket and sheet. We all head downstairs just as the guard comes in yelling my name. Daddy walks behind us. It\\u2019s all happening so fast, and I call out my goodbyes. Daddy grabs my arm. I think she\\u2019s going to hug me, but she pulls me in close. \\u201cYou know what to do when you come back.\\u201d I pull back and look at her blankly. \\u201cYou will know the date when you will be remanded. You will have time to prepare. Got it?\\u201d I nod quickly. She\\u2019s talking about drugs, but there\\u2019s no time to clarify what she\\u2019s asking for specifically because the guard is walking out the door, and I\\u2019m running after him with everything in my arms. I\\u2019m rushed through booking, where I turn in my reds and change into the clothes I was wearing when I was arrested. When I walk out of the jail, DJ is standing beside his mom\\u2019s car waiting for me. He hugs me, and I hang on to him for a long time. The night air is crisp, and there are stars in the sky. \\u201cI told you I would get you out. Who takes care of you?\\u201d \\u201cYou do,\\u201d I say. \\u201cYou do.\\u201d And in this moment, I believe it\\u2019s true. I feel warm and safe in DJ\\u2019s arms, and for a brief mindless moment I believe it will all be okay. My mother-in-law is waiting in the car, and she barely speaks to me as we drive away. It\\u2019s only when we start to drive over Highway 17 toward San Jose that I realize we aren\\u2019t going to our home in Aptos. \\u201cWhere are we going?\\u201d \\u201cWe have to go sign some papers at the bail bond place, and then we\\u2019re going to stay at the Saratoga house and my mom\\u2019s going to the San Jose house,\\u201d DJ explains. His mom owns two houses in Silicon Valley that she splits her time in. He\\u2019s talking so quickly that I wouldn\\u2019t be surprised if he\\u2019s high. \\u201cNot our house?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t go there, remember?\\u201d He looks back at me from the passenger seat. When I don\\u2019t say anything he\\u2019s suddenly angry. \\u201cWhen they set that fucking ridiculous bail, they also set fucking ridiculous conditions.\\u201d \\u201cWhat conditions?\\u201d I should know this, but I wasn\\u2019t planning to be alive for long, so I hadn\\u2019t paid attention in court. And I haven\\u2019t wanted to read the legal papers because I didn\\u2019t think there was anything in them I could take issue with. After all, I was guilty of everything they\\u2019d charged me with. \\u201cWe aren\\u2019t allowed in our fucking neighborhood, so we\\u2019re not allowed back in our house. The house we own. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how they can do that when we haven\\u2019t been convicted,\\u201d he rages on. \\u201cIt\\u2019s supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. We can\\u2019t go to our home, they can search us at any time, no alcohol, no drugs\\u2026\\u201d For the first time, I realize I\\u2019ll never see our home again. I didn\\u2019t appreciate it while I had it, and now that it\\u2019s gone, I miss it desperately. \\u201c\\u2026 no computers, no contact\\u2026\\u201d I stare out the window as he rants. Even though I\\u2019ve been inside for only two and a half months, the world looks unreal to me. I think about what\\u2019s happening in G right now and whether my boys know I\\u2019m out. \\u201cWill we be able to see the kids?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cTomorrow we have to see our public defenders, then go to CPS and meet with the social worker. There\\u2019s a lot to do tomorrow.\\u201d I haven\\u2019t had an \\u201ca lot to do\\u201d day in a long time. I can\\u2019t imagine myself in offices, talking to people, dealing with reality. One of the best things about being locked up was that the outside world was locked out. I scan myself for inner strength, but all I sense is a faint pulse. If I rolled down my window, I believe I could float out of the car like an errant balloon. I feel untethered. My mother-in-law drops us off in Saratoga and heads to her home seven miles away. \\u201cThank you,\\u201d I call after her as she drives off. I walk around her house like I\\u2019m visiting the moon\\u2014it all feels so foreign and strange. It\\u2019s a big, single-level ranch-style home with a giant pool out back surrounded by grapevines. We used to bring Kaden here to swim; it was always sunny and bright\\u2014my favorite place to spend an afternoon. I open the fridge and gaze in awe at all the food. Eggs and butter and bread and fruit and vegetables. I open all the cabinets and find crackers and coffee and chips and almonds and pistachios. Four kinds of cereal. I sink into her leather couch and savor its softness. It has been so long since I\\u2019ve felt softness. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to take a shower,\\u201d I say. \\u201cHot water\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWant company?\\u201d DJ gives me a little leer, and I smile. \\u201cLet me do the first one alone.\\u201d I go into the bathroom and lock the door behind me. I reach out and open the medicine cabinet to see what\\u2019s inside. There\\u2019s nothing but deodorant and Band-Aids and eye drops. A bottle of Tylenol. Only after I close the cabinet do I realize what I\\u2019ve just done. What\\u2019s still automatic for me. I turn on the shower and there\\u2019s a knock at the door. \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cMy mom grabbed some clothes from the house. I have no idea what she brought you. She just threw a bunch of stuff in a box. It\\u2019s next to the bed.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, thanks.\\u201d I feel awkward with DJ. The few times we saw each other on the way to and from court felt furtive and dramatic and a little exciting. We were separated lovers. Husband and wife torn asunder. But now, here in this domestic setting, I feel just like I did before the arrest. We were headed toward divorce. In the last year, while we were ripping and running, I had cheated on DJ with a man I met online who lived in Oregon. When I was loaded, I had gone to a website that married people visit when they want to cheat. I had seen the man only a few times, and they were thrilling. DJ had found out, but we never really dealt with it, and then we were arrested. I look in the mirror before I get in the shower. I am still thin but not as gaunt and gray as when I was arrested. My diet of bear claws and mystery meat has not given me the rosy glow of health. Everyone in jail is dehydrated\\u2014living on the equivalent of one glass of water a day. The water that comes out of the bathroom sink tastes like rust, and no one can stand drinking more than a few sips at a time. I bet there would be less fighting, less depression, less severe mental health issues in jail if there were clean water, fruits and vegetables, and food that wasn\\u2019t so processed and rancid. I turn around slowly on tiptoe, trying to see my whole body. I haven\\u2019t had a real mirror in so long, just the murky fun-house mirrors in G. I have more muscle thanks to the fire camp workouts. But I also have the corpse-like pallor of someone who hasn\\u2019t felt direct sunlight in months. The shower is like going to church. I stand in the stream of hot water, awed by its majestic power, and wash away G block until the water runs cold. I want to cry, need to cry, but I feel so disembodied that the need isn\\u2019t connecting to my tear ducts. In my mind I am sobbing and shaking because I\\u2019m so scared of whatever might happen next. But after stepping out of the shower I feel robotic. In the bedroom, DJ has lit candles, and he holds out a soft robe for me. We make love, and it feels like nothing at all. I fake the pleasure to get it over with. Even with the full weight of him on top of me, I still feel alone and lost. After, I lay awake for hours among the soft pillows and blankets worrying about our attorney visits the next day, about what CPS will say. And I think of my boys asleep in their beds. I\\u2019m even farther from them now than I was in G. At least in G I could think about them possibly driving by the jail on their way to basketball games or their friends\\u2019 houses. When I took a breath in the courtyard, I could imagine them breathing the same air nearby. Sometimes I would exhale and imagine my breath flying through the sky, across town, and under the crack of the door in the house where they slept. I imagined that my breath washed over them, settling into their skin, their pores, burrowing deep until it joined the blood cells traveling through their bodies. I imagined that for a brief second they could feel my love as my breath pumped through their hearts. In the morning, we take Carol\\u2019s car to go to our appointments in Santa Cruz. As codefendants we have separate public defenders, mostly in case one of us wants to turn on the other at trial. DJ drops me off at my attorney\\u2019s office and promises to pick me up when he\\u2019s done. Elizabeth is grim and angry when I walk in. \\u201cThis is so dangerous,\\u201d she tells me. \\u201cI\\u2019m working on a plea deal for you. I\\u2019d rather you were locked up and safe than out. We talked about this.\\u201d \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know I was getting bailed out,\\u201d I say. \\u201cIt was a surprise.\\u201d \\u201cWell, that surprise could end up meaning prison time.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to do anything wrong,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI promise. I\\u2019m over two months clean.\\u201d She ignores my words and my sobriety. \\u201cIf you steal, if you do drugs, if you break any laws\\u2014you will go to prison. If you go to trial\\u2014you will go to prison. If you do what your husband does\\u2014you will go to prison. This plea deal is tenuous. People are really angry and they\\u2019re going to be even angrier that you\\u2019re out on bail.\\u201d \\u201cWhat people?\\u201d \\u201cYour neighbors. Your ex-husband\\u2019s wife. The DA is getting all kinds of calls from them. You really pissed people off. They are putting lots of pressure on him, and he\\u2019s angry at you because they\\u2019re angry at him.\\u201d \\u201cWait, the DA or the assistant DA prosecuting us?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s all the same, the ADA is the DA\\u2019s office. The DA represents the people. The people are mad.\\u201d \\u201cI swear I won\\u2019t do anything wrong.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what else to say. She seems satisfied she\\u2019s made her point and that I\\u2019ve heard her. \\u201cWe\\u2019re working on a plea deal. You\\u2019re looking at a year in jail, completion of drug court, and five years of probation plus restitution.\\u201d \\u201cHow much is restitution?\\u201d \\u201cAround nineteen thousand dollars.\\u201d \\u201cWhat? That\\u2019s impossible.\\u201d \\u201cAnd you have to pay half up front in order to get the plea deal.\\u201d She shows me all the crimes I\\u2019m charged with. I read down the list\\u2014many of them I actually didn\\u2019t do. I try to protest, point out that I never stole anything from a vehicle at Costco, and that I don\\u2019t know these people listed here who say I stole from them. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t matter, you can only argue each charge at trial. With a plea deal it\\u2019s all or nothing. You\\u2019d have to plead guilty to thirty-two felonies. With a trial you could be in jail just waiting to go to trial for as long as the plea deal sentence. And if you\\u2019re found guilty it will be a much longer sentence.\\u201d \\u201cSo I either plead guilty to all of this\\u2014even the things I didn\\u2019t do\\u2014or go to trial and most likely go to prison?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s it,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWith drug court you can get your record expunged once you successfully complete it. That\\u2019s a yearlong program after you get out.\\u201d It feels unfair that I must plead guilty to crimes I didn\\u2019t commit, but I shove that feeling away. I don\\u2019t have the luxury of fairness. I get it\\u2014every unsolved credit card crime, every property theft, needs to be solved, and someone needs to pay restitution. The DA gets to clear a bunch of crimes off his slate, the victims will get paid by me, and I avoid prison. I have no legal grounds to demand I pay only for what I\\u2019ve done. I also have no money and no idea how I\\u2019ll pay. But I\\u2019ll plead guilty to a hundred felonies if it means I can be with my boys sooner. If it means I can get Kaden back before the CPS clock runs out. I feel nauseous. I push the list over to Elizabeth, but she hands it back to me. \\u201cThis is your copy.\\u201d Elizabeth hands me the restitution list, and I see all the money various victims and nonvictims say I must pay them, based on pain and suffering and days of lost wages because they had to cancel a credit card. I am surprised to find any of these people on a restitution list. If a credit card company or bank wrote off the debt, shouldn\\u2019t I pay back the company or the bank? If you report a card stolen, you don\\u2019t have to pay the charge. I see on the list one of my neighbors claiming lost wages at $150 an hour. She works as an assistant in a medical office. That would be over a $300,000-a-year salary. There are a million different ways for people to steal, but not all stealing is considered a crime. Nobody was going to get prosecuted for stealing from me. I shake this thought away. Who am I to judge? I\\u2019m in no position to assess morality or integrity. I have no high ground to stand on. \\u201cWith the time you\\u2019ve already served, and time off for good behavior, we\\u2019re talking six or seven more months in jail. You\\u2019ll get moved to Blaine Street, and hopefully it won\\u2019t be so bad.\\u201d I start doing the math in my head\\u2014trying to figure out if I will have time to complete everything CPS will require me to do. The one-year clock to get Kaden back started ticking almost three months ago. I obviously need to be out of jail. I need a job. A place to live. Drug testing. I need to take a parenting class. I need to go to counseling. I need to have supervised visits and prove to CPS that I can and will keep my son safe. I\\u2019m not even sure I know how to keep myself safe, but for the first time in a long time, I feel hope. I don\\u2019t care how much I have to pay or who I have to pay it to. A year from now I could be back with all my children. This could be behind me. I could be free. \\u201cDo you really think I can do the plea deal? What about DJ?\\u201d \\u201cHe will have the same deal. Restitution will be joint and several, meaning you are both equally obligated to pay it back. And you both have to accept the plea.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how we would pay nine or ten thousand up front.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to find a way.\\u201d \\u201cI guess I could put it on a credit card\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cNot funny!\\u201d she snaps. \\u201cAnd you have to go see Probation while you\\u2019re out. They do an assessment and will make a recommendation to the court on sentencing. Call and make an appointment right away.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, but if there\\u2019s a plea deal\\u2026?\\u201d \\u201cThey still make a sentencing recommendation. Anything can happen. The judge could reject the plea deal. It doesn\\u2019t happen often, but it can.\\u201d I say my goodbyes and stand out on the street waiting for DJ. It\\u2019s all a lot to take in, and I\\u2019m not sure I understand all my obligations. DJ finally arrives about half an hour later. \\u201cWhere were you?\\u201d \\u201cMaya was quick, so I went and met up with some homeboys who I was in with.\\u201d Maya is his attorney. \\u201cDid she tell you about the plea deal?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s all some fucking bullshit with the charges and that restitution.\\u201d \\u201cBut we\\u2019re going to take it, right?\\u201d \\u201cI want to go to trial.\\u201d \\u201cWe can\\u2019t, we can\\u2019t go to trial. Kaden. Think about Kaden!\\u201d I am instantly angry and slightly hysterical. \\u201cYou have to agree, you have to take this. We both do. You don\\u2019t want to go to prison. Are you crazy?\\u201d \\u201cRelax, we\\u2019re going to take it, it\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019s just some bullshit, though.\\u201d In a way I envy DJ\\u2019s anger. His lack of shame. \\u201cDid you see that charge from\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cStop!\\u201d I say. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to talk about any of it. I can\\u2019t handle it. Do you understand? That was so hard to get through, and I have nothing left in me today.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, but now we have to go to CPS.\\u201d \\u201cI know. Let\\u2019s just go and get it over with.\\u201d The harried social worker seems surprised to see us even though we have an appointment. She shuffles through large stacks of files to find Kaden\\u2019s. \\u201cWhat about seeing Kaden?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cCan we see him?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll have to talk to the Parents Center\\u2014they are who we contract with to supervise the visits. They will coordinate with the foster parents and you. We just didn\\u2019t know you would be out to do this.\\u201d I realize there are no visitation plans in place because she didn\\u2019t think we\\u2019d ever be out. \\u201cI\\u2019ll call you when I know more,\\u201d she says. DJ and I drive away, and all the hope I felt earlier is gone. I\\u2019m hungry and tired and overwhelmed. \\u201cLet\\u2019s just go home,\\u201d I say. Part of me craves the simplicity and isolation of jail. \\u201cI just have to make a quick stop,\\u201d says DJ. I lean the passenger seat way back and close my eyes. When I open them, I see DJ has pulled into a hospital parking lot. It\\u2019s the hospital where I gave birth to Cody. \\u201cWait here,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI\\u2019ll be right back.\\u201d \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d \\u201cI just have to pick something up,\\u201d he says, jumping out of the car. It\\u2019s almost 5 p.m. and getting dark. I sit in the parking lot for over an hour. We don\\u2019t have cell phones or I would call him. A security guard taps on the window to ask me what I\\u2019m doing, and I explain that I\\u2019m waiting for my husband. \\u201cIs he a patient?\\u201d he asks. \\u201cHe\\u2019s visiting someone,\\u201d I say, the lie rolling off my tongue with ease. I suddenly feel guilty and afraid. It helps that I\\u2019m sitting in my mother-in-law\\u2019s Mercedes. I am still skinny from my pre-jail diet of Vicodin and chocolate, but I\\u2019m dressed nicely for our appointments so I don\\u2019t overly concern the guard. And I haven\\u2019t done anything wrong. DJ finally shows up, breathless and hurrying. He doesn\\u2019t explain his absence, and I don\\u2019t ask. My anxiety is building, and I recall my attorney\\u2019s warnings. When we get over the mountain and away from Santa Cruz, he passes the exit to Saratoga. I still don\\u2019t say a word. He pulls into an IHOP in a strip mall in San Jose and parks on the outskirts of the lot away from the other cars. He reaches under his seat and pulls out a velvet bag. In it there\\u2019s a small metal tin, a lighter, a rubber band, and a clump of black tar heroin about the size of a silver dollar. \\u201cI told you I met with some guys from jail while you were in your meeting,\\u201d he says. \\u201cAnd then I grabbed this from the hospital.\\u201d He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a long, skinny object sealed in paper and plastic. In the dome light I can read the words BIOPSY Needle and STERILE. \\u201cIt\\u2019s huge,\\u201d he says, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s all I could find.\\u201d I have been driving in a car with drugs in it. I was in the getaway car while he stole from the hospital. I have already violated the terms of my bail agreement. \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to love this,\\u201d he says as he pushes up the sleeve of my sweater. I am mute as he melts the heroin into liquid and draws it into the needle. Yes, this is something I swore I would never do. But I don\\u2019t have the strength to resist. He ties the band around my arm. I watch as if from a distance as he sticks the needle in my vein. It stings and tugs and burns, and then he pulls back a little on the plunger. I see my own blood folded into the brown liquid, and then before I can even take a breath, he presses the plunger aggressively and empties the needle into my vein. For a moment I feel nothing, and then warmth spreads through me. Excitement. Joy. Energy. Every good feeling flows through me. The shower wasn\\u2019t church, this is church. All the day\\u2019s pain washes away. A part of me marvels at this new, more efficient way of getting high. No inhaling smoke through a straw for hours. No swallowing twenty pills. I\\u2019ve always loved efficiency. I don\\u2019t think about the fact that it\\u2019s also a more efficient way of killing myself or that this is what killed my own brother. My attorney\\u2019s words of warning are forgotten. My brief, fragile sobriety is gone. As the heroin swallows me like a pill, I close my eyes and pretend this is good. I pretend this is love. \\n chapter 11 THE NEIGHBOR FROM HELL The heroin makes it easy to cope with what\\u2019s to come, and I quickly learn how to shoot up all by myself. DJ\\u2019s mom wants us to be where she can keep an eye on us, so we move into the spare bedroom in her San Jose house where she now lives full time. We lock the door and sit on the floor and start our day with the ritual of injecting heroin. Breaking off a chunk of the black rock and holding a lighter underneath a tiny, silver-dollar-size metal pot DJ has acquired from some DIY crafts store so that it liquefies. I have no idea how much heroin is enough, or how much is too much. DJ seems to be an expert, so he measures it out and draws it into the syringe. He has gone to a needle exchange place, so the giant biopsy needle has been replaced by dozens of tiny needles like the ones diabetics use. \\u201cIt\\u2019s great,\\u201d he says. \\u201cYou bring back the used, and they give you new ones.\\u201d Once in a while I try to talk to him about the risk we are taking\\u2014how we are violating the terms of bail and putting our plea bargain in jeopardy\\u2014but he shuts me down. He assures me that because we live outside the county we won\\u2019t be surprise searched. The more times I shoot heroin, the less I worry. I am living in the moment. It\\u2019s a bastardized version of the present I learned about in The Power of Now. DJ and I soon realize that it\\u2019s impossible to subsidize a heroin habit without getting a job or committing a crime. A job is out of the question since we\\u2019re due to be sentenced in a month. Plus, getting high is once again our full-time work. So we have to brainstorm. One morning DJ disappears into the master bedroom closet. When he comes out, he is holding three suit jackets, all with the tags on them. \\u201cYou won\\u2019t believe what\\u2019s in there,\\u201d he says. \\u201cTons of new clothes. All from Nordstrom.\\u201d I don\\u2019t understand what he\\u2019s so excited about. The jackets are obviously his stepdad Freddy\\u2019s, who is currently living in Iran. \\u201cNordstrom has the most amazing return policy,\\u201d says DJ. I shrug like he\\u2019s maybe lost his mind, but I want to be polite about it. \\u201cThe tags are still on. We can return these. For cash.\\u201d I see where he is going with this, but I also see a problem. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have the receipts,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t return something without a receipt.\\u201d \\u201cYou can at Nordstrom,\\u201d says DJ. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go!\\u201d When we get to the store I refuse to go inside. I don\\u2019t even like returning things that I have legitimately bought, so I\\u2019m certainly not going to return something I didn\\u2019t buy. They will see my guilt a mile away. I sit in the car and watch all the shoppers passing by. Are any of them doing nefarious deeds\\u2014or am I the shadiest person in this lot? After half an hour, I start to get anxious. What if DJ has been arrested? The minute I think this, the drugs wear off. I am me again, and I am wondering what the fuck I\\u2019m doing here. I vow that if DJ comes out, we will get clean. We will not do anything shady. We will focus on what\\u2019s important\\u2014getting Kaden back. I start to pray. When he finally emerges, he\\u2019s not carrying the clothes and he\\u2019s not in handcuffs. I exhale and try to read his face to see what emotion he is conveying. He looks pissed. I don\\u2019t say a word as he gets behind the wheel. It\\u2019s only when we are pulling out of the parking lot that he turns to me. \\u201cA little over three hundred,\\u201d he says before I can even ask. He says this so proudly, like a stockbroker with a bullish pick that has paid off. \\u201cThere was such a long line at returns; we need to go to a different Nordstrom next time. And they gave me a hassle without the receipts. Asking how I had paid for the suits so they could refund the correct payment method. I got it done, though.\\u201d And just like that I forget my parking-lot vow to get clean. The next time DJ goes into the closet he comes out with a giant bag of receipts. \\u201cI think Freddy has every receipt for all those clothes.\\u201d \\u201cIt looks like he has every receipt he\\u2019s ever gotten.\\u201d We empty the bag onto the dining room table and start pulling out the Nordstrom ones, and then we try to match the receipt numbers to the clothes in the closet that still have tags on them. It\\u2019s time-consuming, so I ask DJ why we are doing this if the return policy is so great. \\u201cInsurance,\\u201d he says. With our habit fully funded, we can focus on getting shit done. We meet with our separate probation officers for our reviews and find out they are recommending four years in prison. I\\u2019m glad the twenty-seven years is no longer on the table, but four years means we will lose Kaden. The plea deal must go through. CPS wasn\\u2019t prepared for us to be out on bail, and because we are temporarily living in a different county, they are stymied about how to handle this new development. I call the social worker every day to see if I can have a supervised visit with Kaden, go to court-ordered therapy, take some positive-discipline classes, anything that will move me closer to meeting their requirements for reunifying with him by the one-year deadline. But nothing moves quickly in the system, and CPS is waiting to see if I\\u2019m sentenced to prison before they start me with services to reunify. I haven\\u2019t seen my older boys once since I\\u2019ve been out. Every time I try to arrange something with Bryan and Darcy, they are magically busy. I\\u2019m desperate to see my boys, see how they are, see if they are angry or sad. I talk to them on the phone, but I need to hold them. I need to look in their eyes and be sure they are doing as okay as they say. I need to look in their eyes and see if they still love me. It\\u2019s a tightrope to walk because while CPS has barred me from seeing Kaden without CPS arranging and controlling the visit, Dylan, Cody, and Ty aren\\u2019t under the control of CPS. But they are under the control of Bryan and Darcy. I can\\u2019t just show up at their house because that\\u2019s also where Kaden lives. I don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m in any place to demand my right to see them. I\\u2019m not even sure what my rights are while I\\u2019m out on bail. All I know is I don\\u2019t want to make Bryan and Darcy angry. DJ\\u2019s ex is fine with him seeing Hailey and Logan while he\\u2019s out, but I skip those visits. I don\\u2019t have the energy to be a stepmom to them when I can\\u2019t be a mom to my own. It\\u2019s not kind, but it\\u2019s true. Plus, I feel safer in San Jose than in Santa Cruz. I\\u2019m too afraid I will run into a neighbor or a friend from recovery or a parent I know from school or the deputies who arrested me. I feel exposed in Santa Cruz. Vulnerable. In San Jose, I\\u2019m anonymous. Cody is on the high school varsity basketball team, and when I find out last minute that they have a game in San Jose near where we\\u2019re staying I decide to go to the gym. I can\\u2019t wait to see him, even from a distance. I want to cheer him on. It\\u2019s a workaround that doesn\\u2019t require talking to and scheduling with Bryan and Darcy, and DJ agrees to go with me. When we arrive it\\u2019s halftime, and the minute I step through the doors I look across the court and my breath catches. Kaden is dribbling a toddler-sized basketball. Our eyes lock, and he drops the ball and sprints over to me. I scoop him up and smother him with kisses and hugs. Bryan walks over. \\u201cHey,\\u201d I say. \\u201cHey.\\u201d \\u201cI had no idea you would be here, he would be here. I don\\u2019t know what the rules are with CPS when I run into him in a public place. I\\u2019m sorry, I had no idea. I\\u2019m not trying to do something\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not worried about it,\\u201d says Bryan. \\u201cI can just leave,\\u201d I say, but Kaden is already holding on to my leg. \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine.\\u201d Kaden sits on my lap for the second half of the game, and I kiss his cheeks and the back of his head every few seconds. He is warm and soft, and I close my eyes and inhale his scent over and over. He looks small to me, as if he hasn\\u2019t grown a bit since I was arrested. I bring him back to Bryan when the game ends. \\u201cThank you,\\u201d I say. Bryan just laughs\\u2014it\\u2019s not a real laugh, just the way he laughs when things are awkward. I give Cody a big hug. \\u201cCan I take the older boys to lunch in a couple of weeks?\\u201d I ask Bryan. \\u201cPlease?\\u201d He is quiet. DJ is on the other side of the gym. He doesn\\u2019t want to talk to Bryan, and I\\u2019m annoyed that he can\\u2019t be gracious toward my ex. Thankful, even. If it weren\\u2019t for Bryan, Kaden would be with strangers. \\u201cI guess so. Let me talk to Darcy.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re their dad. It\\u2019s not really up to her,\\u201d I say quietly. I want him to grow a spine, but I get it. He just shrugs and picks Kaden up. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go, buddy.\\u201d I blow kisses to Kaden over Bryan\\u2019s shoulder all the way across the gym and until he\\u2019s out the door. Cody lets me hug him again even though he\\u2019s sixteen, and his teammates are watching, and I\\u2019m his mom who\\u2019s out on bail. \\u201cI love you,\\u201d I whisper in his ear. \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m so, so, sorry.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, Mom,\\u201d says Cody. \\u201cI love you too. Just get better, please.\\u201d We are halfway home and I\\u2019m in bliss, not because of any heroin, but because I got to hold Kaden, see Cody. When my cell phone rings, I answer it without looking at the number. \\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\\u2019re doing? You are going back to jail!\\u201d I recognize Darcy\\u2019s voice immediately. She\\u2019s screaming. \\u201cYou aren\\u2019t allowed to see Kaden; you just violated the CPS order. I\\u2019m calling them in the morning.\\u201d I panic and try to explain that it was an accident and that I had no way of knowing he would be there. \\u201cBryan said it was okay,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI offered to leave when we came in, but he said it was okay.\\u201d She hangs up on me. \\u201cOh my God,\\u201d I say to DJ. \\u201cWhat do we do?\\u201d I start to hyperventilate. \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not fine. It\\u2019s not going to be fine.\\u201d I\\u2019m so scared I can barely breathe. Following all CPS rules is a condition of bail. If we violate bail, the judge won\\u2019t accept the plea. \\u201cCall the social worker.\\u201d I call the social worker and leave her a long, rambling message about what happened. It gets cut off, so I call back and start all over again. I am awake all night watching the clock. I call again at 8 a.m. and beg the social worker to call me. All morning I sit and stare at my phone. Finally, at 1 p.m. the social worker calls. She seems unconcerned. \\u201cIt happens,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t tell me if Darcy called her or what was said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to arrange a supervised visit for you while you\\u2019re out, but it\\u2019s been\\u2026 umm\\u2026 difficult.\\u201d I think I know the name of the difficulty\\u2014the one screaming at me on the phone last night. When we hang up, I lie on the bed, relieved. This all has to stop, I think. We need to stop using. I say it and I mean it, but the truth is, I can\\u2019t stop. I won\\u2019t stop. And I have no idea why. My attorney was right, I was safer in G. I\\u2019m not ready to be out in the world. I\\u2019m not recovered, not even close. I\\u2019m worse than I ever was. I can\\u2019t stop hurting myself even when I know it\\u2019s hurting my boys. I don\\u2019t know how to cope with the normal everyday world of minor problems without drugs, so I certainly have no way to cope with life when my freedom is at risk. When my children are at risk. I fall asleep to these thoughts and wake up an hour later in so much pain I can\\u2019t breathe. My left arm is swollen from elbow to fingertips. It looks like a giant balloon animal. If balloon animals were covered in track marks. I have no idea what it is. DJ is sitting on the floor preparing his medicine. \\u201cDJ,\\u201d I whisper. \\u201cYeah?\\u201d He looks up. \\u201cCan you take me to the hospital?\\u201d In the emergency room the triage nurse takes my vitals and looks at my arm, which is now twice as big as it was when I woke up. It\\u2019s so swollen I can\\u2019t bend my fingers. I have to hold the entire arm up with my right hand. I\\u2019m like the girl in Willy Wonka who blew up into a blueberry. \\u201cWhy did you do this to yourself?\\u201d she asks. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I say. I wish I knew. I wish I could say I did this because this one thing happened to me this one time. It would be so much easier for everyone. I wish I could trace it to being born prematurely, or early-childhood attachment issues, or being abandoned, starved, abused. I wish I could say it\\u2019s because every time in my life I\\u2019ve wanted to say no to someone I never have. I wish I could say it\\u2019s because of karma. A past life where I agreed to be an addict in this life. I would blame it on my brain chemistry if I could, or a mental health diagnosis if I had one. It would be so much easier if every addict knew why they were destroying themselves. When I\\u2019m on drugs, I feel happy, I feel like I belong in the world, I feel joy no matter what else is happening around me. Drugs give me what I\\u2019m looking for, what I need and crave. The truth is simple: Getting high feels better than not getting high. And until that changes, no addict will change. I am admitted to the hospital and immediately placed on IV antibiotics. The heroin has caused a massive infection in my arm, and most likely it\\u2019s been building for weeks. I just hadn\\u2019t noticed. The doctors are worried about sepsis. When my fever spikes dangerously high I make DJ promise nobody will know I\\u2019m here. \\u201cThey can\\u2019t,\\u201d I say. \\u201cNot Bryan and Darcy. Not the boys. Nobody!\\u201d The doctors are pumping morphine into my system for the pain in my arm, which prevents me from detoxing. A week after I\\u2019ve been admitted DJ comes to see me. \\u201cMy mom and I went to the Aptos house and packed everything up. I got permission from the judge.\\u201d \\u201cDid you see any neighbors?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cNo. And I wouldn\\u2019t care if I did.\\u201d I don\\u2019t understand DJ\\u2019s anger. It\\u2019s like he doesn\\u2019t feel bad for what we did. I would be mortified if I saw anyone and I\\u2019m grateful I didn\\u2019t have to pack up our home. \\u201cThey\\u2019re foreclosing on the house,\\u201d DJ tells me. I close my eyes. A part of me thought maybe I would still have a home for my boys when this was all over. I just want to make them breakfast and dinner. I want to be annoyed that I have to pick up after them. I want to sit on the edge of their beds and hear about their friends and their schoolwork. But it\\u2019s gone. All of it. When I open my eyes, DJ is fiddling with my IV. \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d \\u201cI brought you a present.\\u201d He pulls out a needle with brown liquid in it. \\u201cWatch this.\\u201d He quickly inserts the needle into my IV port, and the heroin flows through the tube and into my arm. A warm rush floods my system and I close my eyes. I surrender. This is who I am. This is what I do. There\\u2019s an angry mob of about twenty people outside the courtroom doors. The mob is composed of my neighbors, and Darcy almost seems to be its leader, with Bryan by her side. Who is watching Kaden if they\\u2019re both here watching me? DJ and I spent the night in a motel near the courtroom. We are to officially plead guilty to thirty-two felonies, and per the plea deal will each get one year in jail and a year in drug court. The judge still has to approve the plea and sentence, though. And after the court appearance, we\\u2019ll go directly back to jail. We were up all night using and preparing to go back inside. When we get to the courthouse our attorneys meet us outside the courtroom and escort us away from the mob. \\u201cWe have a problem,\\u201d says my new attorney, Jonathan. He\\u2019s Elizabeth\\u2019s husband, and he\\u2019s taken over my case while she\\u2019s out with the baby. \\u201cSomeone told the DA who told the judge that you were bragging about your light sentence. Someone told all your neighbors the same thing.\\u201d I am shocked. I never bragged about anything, and I haven\\u2019t talked to anyone about the plea deal. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going in to speak to the judge now, but I need to know what you said and who you said it to.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2026 I\\u2019ve\\u2026 never bragged or talked to anyone.\\u201d \\u201cYou must have. Someone knows the details of the plea.\\u201d I suddenly recall the sushi lunch with my older boys. Bryan had agreed, and we had gone to one of their favorite restaurants. I had told them it was good news, that with good behavior, in six months I would be out of jail and we could get back to our lives. I wasn\\u2019t bragging, I was reassuring my children their mom would be okay. I told them I could get my record expunged. I was trying to cheer them up. They must have told someone, who told someone, and like a twisted game of telephone, someone went to the prosecutor and the neighbors with a distorted version. \\u201cSomeone told the neighbors and the DA you were laughing at them all.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to think it was Darcy in a last-ditch attempt to put me in prison. I\\u2019d much rather believe it was an angry neighbor; and given the sentiment of many of my neighbors it could well have been. Still, nothing gets the ex-wife out of the picture more completely than a long prison sentence. The extreme public humiliation is just a bonus. I shake the thoughts away, because ultimately it doesn\\u2019t matter who it was. It\\u2019s happened. It\\u2019s happening. I risk a glance at the crowd. Darcy is staring at me, her hair perfectly coiffed, her makeup done just so, and her thin lips sneering. She is the Queen of Hearts yelling \\u201cOff with her head!\\u201d Her vitriol feels palpable. Maybe I am reading her wrong, maybe I am projecting, but it all feels surreal and I just want to be anywhere but here. Jonathan clears his throat. \\u201cThe ADA and I are going to talk to the judge in his chambers. Sit here until the bailiff calls everyone in. I\\u2019ll see you in the courtroom.\\u201d We sit on a bench and wait for the bailiff to call us in. I can\\u2019t look at my neighbors\\u2014people I used to think of as friends. People whose houses my boys still play at. I care about these people. I care about their children. Their anger is hard to face. In the entire crowd of my neighbors, I stole from only two of them. It was wrong. I violated them, I know this. I am the perpetrator and they are the victims. They trusted me and I betrayed their trust. I want to run up to each one and say I\\u2019m sorry. I want to hug them and tell them it wasn\\u2019t personal, that it wasn\\u2019t the real me, but I can only sit here with my head down. I think about the dollar amount I stole from my neighbors\\u2014it amounts to a little over five hundred dollars for one family and I used another neighbor\\u2019s social security number to get an Amazon credit card so I could buy a Kindle and a few parenting books. All together it\\u2019s less than a thousand dollars that I have stolen from this mob of neighbors. We had to pay back nine thousand to get the plea deal. I know that what I stole amounts to more than just dollars\\u2014I know that I betrayed all of their trust, their sense of safety in their own homes, and because I have hurt some, I have hurt all. I betrayed this community of cul-de-sac parents not only because I was their friend but also because addicts and criminals aren\\u2019t supposed to host playdates and work on fundraisers and they aren\\u2019t supposed to look like me. Addicts aren\\u2019t supposed to look like them. Criminals are never supposed to live next door. When we go into court, I see someone with a camera off to the side. Every time he aims it at me, I turn away. I try to hold my hands over my face as much as possible and thwart his shot. I can\\u2019t cover my face while the judge addresses me, but otherwise I think I\\u2019ve avoided him getting a clear view. DJ sits next to me, and in the middle of the sentencing he falls asleep because he\\u2019s high. I poke him in the ribs to wake him. One person speaks on our behalf, the director of a local rehab program who knows us and the judge. She stands up and says this is a health problem, a drug problem, not a criminal problem. The jail is overcrowded with people whose crimes are a symptom of their addiction. We are good people, she implores the judge, and the judge acknowledges that many people from the recovery world, people I helped in my six years of sobriety, have written to him on my behalf. DJ and I don\\u2019t speak. Jonathan expresses my remorse for me. DJ\\u2019s lawyer doesn\\u2019t say a word. When the judge approves the plea, I glance over at Darcy. She is frowning. Everyone against me is sitting together with Bryan and Darcy on the opposite side of the courtroom. She and my ex don\\u2019t even live in Aptos, so I don\\u2019t know how they have become so close with our former neighbors. It\\u2019s like a sad wedding where no one is sitting on my side during the ceremony, and the other side is all waiting for their moment to object. Our time out on bail has almost killed me, and I\\u2019m relieved that it\\u2019s over. Two weeks in the hospital has left me weak. Two months of injecting heroin has been two months too many. I just want to get to Blaine Street. CPS has agreed to bring Kaden once a week to see me there. He can sit in my lap, and I can kiss his chubby cheeks. My boys can visit me on the weekends if Bryan brings them. They couldn\\u2019t come to the main jail where visitors are separated by plexiglass and have to speak through telephones. In Blaine Street we can visit in person, we can talk. I am wearing a long skirt and a light blue sweater. When I hold my arms out to the bailiff to handcuff me, I see that blood has seeped through the arms of my sweater. He sees it too. What he doesn\\u2019t see is the tobacco, Vicodin, heroin, and two needles packed into an overstuffed condom and hidden inside me. It was uncomfortable sitting in the courtroom with a vagina full of contraband, and it\\u2019s even harder to walk behind the bailiff. I can feel the package slipping. The van takes us to the main jail, and DJ and I sit in the reception area. We have to get new mugshots taken for our ID cards. A man in his early twenties is sitting in one of the plastic seats behind us. \\u201cWhat are you two doing here?\\u201d \\u201cGoing to jail,\\u201d I say. \\u201cTogether? That\\u2019s so cute.\\u201d I turn to see if he\\u2019s serious, and he is. It\\u2019s not cute, and I\\u2019m exhausted and just want to get to my bunk and lie down. I know I\\u2019m going to detox all over again in G, but hopefully it won\\u2019t be worse than the first time, which was bad but not so bad that a few hot water bottles didn\\u2019t make me feel better. I know the girls in G will take care of me. Especially when they find out what I\\u2019m bringing them. I can\\u2019t go to Blaine Street until the classification officer sends me. Hopefully it will happen within the week. Now that I\\u2019m sentenced, I can count down the days until I\\u2019m out. Now that I\\u2019m sentenced, I can make a plan with CPS for reunification. Now that I\\u2019m sentenced, I can separate from DJ. I know I\\u2019m about to be locked up again for three times as long as before, but in many ways it feels like freedom. I don\\u2019t have to worry about anything on the outside besides my boys. DJ leaves first, and then a female guard I don\\u2019t recognize takes me into the big room where we spent the night in the cage. I know there is a lawsuit pending about strip searches in the jail, it\\u2019s been all over the local news, so I\\u2019ve been pretty confident I won\\u2019t have one. But now that I\\u2019m here and about to change into my reds, it hits me how stupid it is to be carrying drugs in. If I get caught it\\u2019s another charge, and I definitely won\\u2019t get to Blaine Street. The guard has me walk through a metal detector, which is new. When I do it goes off: a loud shriek and a flashing red light. I hold out my hands, and then I show her I have no pockets. She pats me down and has me walk through again. Everything lights up and I begin to sweat. Fuck. I walk through for a third time and when it goes off I grasp at anything to explain it to her other than the needles in my vagina. \\u201cI\\u2019m wearing an underwire bra,\\u201d I say. \\u201cLook.\\u201d I lean forward so she can look down the V of my sweater. She is quiet for a moment and then shrugs and says okay. She takes off my handcuffs so I can change, and I surreptitiously shove the package back up inside me while putting on the jail-issued granny panties. She gives me my bedding, and this time I know to ask for my hygiene and a cup. When I step into G, there is a moment of silence before everyone starts yelling, \\u201cMama Love! Mama Love!\\u201d Kiki and Vivian and Nina run up to hug me. Daddy is on the top tier next to a woman I don\\u2019t recognize who is giving me the once-over and looking skeptical. Kiki pulls me up the stairs and into the room at the top I used to share with Patricia. \\u201cThis is our room,\\u201d she says. Daddy and Vivian pile in after her while Nina stands watch outside the door. I am happy to see them all, but I just want to sleep. A long day in court has taken its toll, and I can feel myself starting to detox. I\\u2019m not ready for that. I\\u2019m hoping to use what I brought in to medically detox myself\\u2014taper my dose a little bit each day. I pull out the condom and empty the contents on Kiki\\u2019s bed. While they look at the gifts I\\u2019ve brought, I flush the condom down the toilet. The guards go through our trash. \\u201cI brought two needles,\\u201d I say. \\u201cOne is mine. You guys can share the other one or not, but I don\\u2019t share mine.\\u201d I break off some heroin and give each of them a piece. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll share the tobacco,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThe pills are mine to help with detox.\\u201d Nina opens the door, startling us. \\u201cDon\\u2019t forget about me,\\u201d she says, quickly scanning Kiki\\u2019s bed and our hands to see what we have. \\u201cNever,\\u201d I say, and I break off a piece of my heroin for her. When everyone leaves, Kiki and I quickly catch up. \\u201cDid you get the deluxe chocolate package I sent to you from commissary?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cWas that you? I had no idea. It was massive. Thanks so much!\\u201d \\u201cOf course,\\u201d I say. I couldn\\u2019t use my real name when I ordered the commissary, because I had used a fake credit card number to purchase the pack. Kiki had helped me, and I wanted to help her. Plus, she loved chocolate. \\u201cHow are things in here?\\u201d I ask. She settles in to give me all the gossip from the two months I\\u2019ve been gone. \\u201cThings aren\\u2019t the same in here since you left,\\u201d she says. \\u201cThere have been some bad fights. There\\u2019s this one chick locked in solitary in Nina\\u2019s old room below us. She\\u2019s a fighter, but they don\\u2019t have room anywhere else for her. Did you see all the sleds?\\u201d \\u201cWhat are sleds?\\u201d \\u201cThe plastic things all over the freeway that look like snow sleds?\\u201d I hadn\\u2019t noticed anything when I walked in. \\u201cThe jail is at, like, double capacity. They are going to put sleds in all our rooms too. It\\u2019s such bullshit. They aren\\u2019t allowed to have so many people in here, but nobody cares.\\u201d I look around the room and try to imagine another body living in here\\u2014it seems impossible. \\u201cI\\u2019m getting to Blaine Street as fast as I can,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThey\\u2019re going to let Kaden visit me there. I got a year sentence but with what I\\u2019ve already done and good time I can be out in September.\\u201d Kiki squeals and jumps up to hug me. \\u201cWe need to make you a calendar,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI have paper and pencils. What\\u2019s your out date?\\u201d We rummage through my court paperwork until we find my out date. \\u201cAfter dinner we\\u2019ll get a little buzz on and then make your calendar. This is the best day ever.\\u201d I smile. \\u201cI just need to take a little nap though, okay?\\u201d \\u201cOkay Mama Love, whatever you need!\\u201d Kiki bounces out of the room, and I know the giddiness she is feeling. It\\u2019s the high before the high. Her dopamine is firing just thinking about the little piece of dope hidden in her bra. I get under the covers and curl up on my side. I push the images of the day in court\\u2014Darcy, my neighbors, the reporter\\u2014out of my head, and I sleep like I have just run a marathon. When I wake up the next morning, I see that Kiki has made me a calendar and taped it on the wall beside my bed. Yesterday is crossed off. It feels like progress. Like hope. When breakfast comes, there\\u2019s a guard I haven\\u2019t seen before. He\\u2019s about my age with short brown hair with a little gray at the temples and a big smile. He\\u2019s someone I would talk to if I ran into him at a bookstore or a bar\\u2014he\\u2019s tall and cute and I\\u2019ve always been a sucker for gray temples. He hands me my tray and I give him a big smile. \\u201cGood morning,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThank you.\\u201d \\u201cWait,\\u201d he says as I start to turn away. \\u201cI have something else for you.\\u201d When I turn back around, he\\u2019s holding today\\u2019s paper. \\u201cYou\\u2019re famous. Or infamous. Should I call you \\u2018The Neighbor from Hell\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cYou can have this one.\\u201d He hands me the Santa Cruz Sentinel and on the front page, in full color, is my face looking up plaintively. The reporter got the shot. My picture takes up the full half above the fold, the article is below. I see the headline and my stomach drops. APTOS \\u201cNEIGHBORS FROM HELL\\u201d SENTENCED IN MASSIVE ID THEFT CASE. The guard laughs and picks up the next tray. I bring the paper over to the table and sit my tray on it so I don\\u2019t have to look at my picture. I think about my boys going to school today and seeing this. I think about everyone who has ever known me seeing this. I used to coach Little League, I was on the school board, I was a real estate agent way back when I first left Bryan\\u2014everyone I ever did business with is seeing this. I think about the parents of all my boys\\u2019 friends, their teachers, their coaches\\u2014all reading this headline. Massive ID Theft Case. Daddy sits next to me with her tray. \\u201cWhy did he give you a paper?\\u201d she asks. \\u201cBecause I\\u2019m on the front page.\\u201d \\u201cNo way. Give it to me.\\u201d \\u201cNo,\\u201d I say, but Daddy has already pulled it out from under my tray, and she\\u2019s hollering, \\u201cMama Love is in the papers!\\u201d \\u201cStop, please\\u2026\\u201d Daddy starts reading the article out loud. I don\\u2019t want to know what it says. Everyone gathers around as she reads it. G block thinks this is funny, but I can\\u2019t listen. I put my hands over my ears and run up the stairs to my room. I can\\u2019t breathe. My ears are ringing. This isn\\u2019t funny, it\\u2019s a disaster. It\\u2019s my disaster. I will never be able to show my face again in Santa Cruz. When I get out of here, I will have to move. Daddy and Kiki come into the room with the paper. \\u201cHey, sorry,\\u201d says Daddy. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI get it.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s a great picture,\\u201d says Kiki. \\u201cYour skin looks so good.\\u201d They\\u2019re trying to be kind, and kindness is precious in jail. I offer them a weak smile. \\u201cYou want your tray? Nina is guarding it.\\u201d \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not hungry.\\u201d Daddy has the paper in her hand. \\u201cHere,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want it. Can you rip it up and throw it away?\\u201d Daddy nods. \\u201cAt least we can have coffee and a cigarette. Should we post up on the steps outside?\\u201d Kiki seems antsy and I know it\\u2019s because of the stuff I brought. I throw her the tobacco and papers. \\u201cYou go ahead.\\u201d After she leaves, I look at Daddy. \\u201cSo how bad is it\\u2026 the article?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s not great.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I figured.\\u201d I stay high for the next few days and try not to think about the article. When my heroin is finally gone, I go to bed early but wake up a few hours later, shortly after lights out. I am feverish and sick. It feels too quick, but there\\u2019s no mistaking this for what it is\\u2014I\\u2019m detoxing, and it\\u2019s coming in hot. I run to the metal toilet and vomit. \\u201cSorry,\\u201d I say to Kiki when she wakes up. \\u201cSor\\u2026\\u201d I can\\u2019t get any more words out, and the vomiting goes on for hours\\u2014long after there is nothing left to get out. I hang on to the toilet\\u2019s cold rim and shiver and shake while Kiki softly snores. In the early morning everything comes out the other end, and I beg Kiki to give me privacy. It\\u2019s only 4 a.m., but I can\\u2019t be so sick sitting on a toilet with someone in the same small room. \\u201cThe doors are still locked, where can I go?\\u201d Kiki asks grumpily. \\u201cI know\\u2026\\u201d I cry. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d When the locks pop at breakfast, Kiki runs out of the room. I have never felt so ill. Liquid is pouring out of my nose and eyes. I have never detoxed like this. I know there is Vicodin under my pillow but it won\\u2019t help me now. I can\\u2019t even swallow water. Kiki checks on me at lunch. I am lying with my cheek against the cold cement at the base of the toilet. I can\\u2019t get up, but I tell her I\\u2019m fine. One minute I am freezing cold and the next I am burning hot. This is death, I think, this is the death I deserve. At dinner, Kiki comes back in. I try to tell her again that I am fine, but my mouth can\\u2019t form words. I vaguely hear her yelling and I think she is pushing the button, but I am watching from far away, and she is just a tiny, blurry speck on a vast horizon in this small cell. I don\\u2019t register the two guards pulling me off the floor and half carrying me down the stairs and out of G. I come to in the medical unit, and the nurse is pissed. The classification guard is standing over the bed as well. \\u201cYou must have brought something in with you to be so sick now,\\u201d he says. I think of the drugs under my pillow, and I hope Kiki hid them. They will search the room. I am so, so stupid. I risked my whole family yet again for what\\u2014to belong in G? To be a big deal there? \\u201cI just have a slow metabolism,\\u201d I whisper. He shakes his head in disgust. \\u201cYou need fluids,\\u201d says the nurse. She hands me some Pedialyte. \\u201cAnd there\\u2019s an abscess in your arm. It\\u2019s infected. You\\u2019re going to get antibiotics three times a day until it clears.\\u201d I have nothing to say in my defense so I sleep. When I get back to G days later, the worst of my detox is over. Kiki is waiting in our room and seems nervous when she sees me. \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen anyone so pale before,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI thought you were dead.\\u201d \\u201cI was,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI kept pushing the button and screaming until they came. It fucking took forever, the motherfuckers.\\u201d \\u201cThanks,\\u201d I say. I look over at my pillow. \\u201cDid you hide the stuff?\\u201d Kiki looks down and away. \\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d \\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t think you were coming back\\u2026\\u201d I realize she must have taken the rest of what I brought in and used it or traded it. In the normal world of jail this would be cause for someone to get rolled up and probably a beatdown. \\u201cI don\\u2019t care,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI\\u2019m done.\\u201d Kiki is relieved and instantly solicitous. \\u201cLet me make you some hot water bottles. Oh, and mail came last night for you. It\\u2019s under the blanket.\\u201d I pull out a large manila envelope and get under the blanket. I don\\u2019t recognize the name or PO box for the return address. It says Mary Hill. I don\\u2019t know a Mary Hill. I open it up and there\\u2019s a giant stack of printed pages\\u2014at least fifty. The first few pages are a photocopy of the newspaper headline and article. Somebody made sure to reduce the size so it fit on a normal page of paper. After the article and in the dozens of pages after is a printout of what must be the online comments to the article. I start reading them and don\\u2019t stop for an hour. Someone writes \\u201cher poor boys,\\u201d and then I see a comment from what must be Darcy writing back: \\u201cthe boys are fine.\\u201d Others talk about how they used to see me at NA meetings\\u2014so much for twelve-step anonymity. I can figure out who a few of the commenters are by their usernames. Others are strangers, though. Hundreds of them. Saying I should be in prison, calling me a sociopath, saying I am the worst kind of person in the world. People who are outraged that I am not going to prison. And then there are the more ominous ones. There are ways to make sure people like that go back once they get out. They will get theirs on the street. I read the comments over and over. And each negative word burrows through my skin and latches onto my bones. The hatred, the vitriol, the threats become a chorus in my head. It sings to me a song of my own badness, and the melody settles in and plays on repeat. Everything I have been before this moment\\u2014daughter, sister, student, teacher, wife, neighbor, volunteer, employee, boss, coach, friend, mother, human\\u2014is gone. The community has spoken. Everything I have been is now erased. There are so many names for me in these comments. I am a criminal, a thief, an addict, a felon, a plague on society, a sociopath, a liar. The Neighbor from Hell. \\n chapter 12 PUSH AND PULL I can\\u2019t go to Blaine Street until the abscess clears, and each passing day makes me more anxious. Daddy leaves for prison, and two of the girls that people had feared coming in from the streets have arrived\\u2014Christina and Denise. We shuffle the rooms, and Kiki and I move back to the big corner room. There are almost more sleds than bunks on the freeway and almost every locked-door cell has a sled in it too. Christina moves into our room and takes an instant dislike to me because I don\\u2019t fawn over her. I have no idea who she is from the streets, but Kiki defers to her. Because Christina doesn\\u2019t like me, Kiki starts treating me differently when she\\u2019s around. It hurts. Every day for a week, a new fight breaks out because someone looked at someone wrong. The overcrowding has made everyone grumpy, and girls press the buzzer to go on time-outs every hour. The guards are stressed. Tensions and tempers rise. Mama Love\\u2019s way of doing time in G is no longer the way. There is bloodshed, there is division among races. The whites and the Latinas who affiliate with the southern, or Sure\\u00f1o, gangs fight with the Blacks and the Latinas who identify with the Norte\\u00f1o, or northern, gangs. There is also rivalry between the Westside and Eastside Gs of Santa Cruz, which, despite the confusing geography, also line up with the Sure\\u00f1os and Norte\\u00f1os in ways I can\\u2019t decipher. Christina has brought in meth. She and Kiki do it and are up all night having sex and I am forced to listen. The next day Kiki takes me aside. \\u201cYou need to do some meth.\\u201d \\u201cWhat? No\\u2026 why?\\u201d \\u201cChristina doesn\\u2019t trust you\\u2014she thinks if you don\\u2019t do some, you\\u2019re a snitch.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s ridiculous,\\u201d I say. But there is no logic in G and certainly not with Christina. Her man is a big-time drug dealer, and all the girls are afraid of him. His power gives Christina power. I don\\u2019t know him, and unless she\\u2019s driving carpool someday, I doubt I will ever see her after G. I can\\u2019t have any trouble if I want to get to Blaine Street. Kiki is stuck in G for her entire two-year sentence this time because she has too many marks against her for smoking and fighting. She\\u2019s also banned because one time when she was in Blaine and working kitchen duty she walked up to the edge of the river that runs along the parking lot and they called it an escape attempt. But she just wanted to see some real water on her way to work. \\u201cShe\\u2019s talking about fighting you.\\u201d I laugh at the idea of fighting Christina, of fighting anyone. I don\\u2019t know how to throw a punch. Kiki is quiet. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think you get that this is serious.\\u201d She whispers, as if Christina is in the room with us. \\u201cYou want to get to your son, you need to do a line and hang with her. Or she can make it so you don\\u2019t get to Blaine. Even if you don\\u2019t start it, if you are in a fight, you can\\u2019t go. She\\u2019ll make sure the guards know you two fought. She\\u2019s done it before. And you can\\u2019t tell her I told you this. And if you tell her the reason you are not doing it is because of your son, she will make sure you don\\u2019t get to Blaine. She has two kids in the system. No parental rights. They were adopted.\\u201d Kiki seems legitimately scared, and now I\\u2019m scared too. When Christina comes in, I avoid looking at her and just stay in my bed and turn to the wall. \\u201cLove,\\u201d she snarls, making my last name into something sarcastic. \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I turn around and see that she\\u2019s standing over my bed. \\u201cAre you going to party with us or what?\\u201d Kiki is nodding over her shoulder. \\u201cI don\\u2019t do meth,\\u201d I say. \\u201cIt makes me too annoyed at everyone. I\\u2019m not into speedy drugs.\\u201d I say this like I\\u2019m telling someone I don\\u2019t drink boxed wine. I even sound snooty to myself. \\u201cDo it or move to the freeway,\\u201d she says. I look to Kiki, but she\\u2019s not meeting my eye. \\u201cAnd if you move to the freeway we are going to meet in the downstairs bathroom. Or you can be chill and roll with us. I only have a little left, you should be grateful I want to share with you.\\u201d I am not grateful. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t need to waste it on me,\\u201d I say. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a waste, it\\u2019s insurance. I don\\u2019t know you or who you reppin\\u2019.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m reppin\\u2019 Aptos,\\u201d I say, and I make an \\u201cA\\u201d with my hands. She doesn\\u2019t think it\\u2019s funny. Kiki is getting agitated. I can\\u2019t get in a fight. It\\u2019s a no-win situation. \\u201cMaybe just a little,\\u201d I say. Kiki stands watch while Christina shakes out a small line of meth on the edge of the sink. She hands me a rolled-up page of a book as a makeshift straw. I get up slowly and walk over to the sink. I look Christina in the eye, so she thinks I\\u2019m unbothered. I lean over and snort the meth as gently as I can. It burns my sinuses, and my eyes water, and I can feel it hit my system instantly. I really do hate speedy drugs, and not sleeping is my least favorite thing to do in G. Now I will be up all night with nothing but regret and racing thoughts to keep me company. I hate the meth immediately. I am anxious and self-conscious and paranoid. After lights out, Christina tells a pointless hour-long story about when she was four and thought her toys were real, and I want to jab a spork in my eye. I feel stupid for being afraid of her, for pretending like I did it because it would be rude not to. Like refusing a glass of wine at a book club, or not eating the cookies at a PTA meeting. I realize I could have just rolled myself up. What do I care where I wait to go to Blaine? I lay in the dark listening to my cellmates\\u2019 meth-fueled sex in the bunk above me and wishing for sleep. When they\\u2019re done, Christina starts talking. \\u201cHey, Love\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cYou ever been to Blaine Street?\\u201d \\u201cNo.\\u201d She knows I haven\\u2019t\\u2014she knows this is my first stint in County. \\u201cWell, I hope they don\\u2019t come tomorrow for you to go over.\\u201d \\u201cWhy?\\u201d \\u201cThey drug test everyone there first thing, and if you test dirty, they send you back to the main jail and you don\\u2019t ever get a chance to go there again.\\u201d She and Kiki start laughing. I\\u2019ve been set up. Kiki was an accomplice, and her betrayal hurts. After they fall asleep, I get up and go to the sink. I put my mouth under the faucet and drink and drink as much of the rusty rancid water as I can. I don\\u2019t know how long a little bit of meth stays in your system. When I can\\u2019t drink any more without vomiting, I lie down. In the morning I pack up my stuff and move down to the freeway. I don\\u2019t speak to Kiki again. Vivian tells me I can come to her room, but I don\\u2019t want to. I am done with the upper tier. I just want out of G, desperately. An hour before lunch a guard comes in and asks who wants to go to church service. I throw on my red shirt and grab my ID card. Anything to get out of here. In the service I tune out on the Bible readings and get lost in my head. I know I can\\u2019t have a life and use drugs. I know I will have to find something other than drugs to fix whatever is broken in me, but I don\\u2019t know how to do that. I realize I haven\\u2019t thought about DJ since we were sentenced a couple of weeks ago. I am relieved to be away from him. I will need to fix that, too, one way or another. I\\u2019m so disappointed in myself for doing the meth. I gave in to Kiki and Christina\\u2019s stupid plan. I put my head down on the table and cry silently. I know that the only thing I need to change is everything. The chaplain, a woman about ten years older than me, tells us that anything we ask for sincerely in prayer, if it\\u2019s for the greater good, will come to us. She tells us to pray right now before we leave. I pray for my desire to use drugs to go away. Forever. I cry silently into my arms, and when everyone gets up to leave I am the last one. The chaplain stops me at the door. \\u201cDid you pray for something?\\u201d I nod. \\u201cSomething big?\\u201d I look at her, and my tears start flowing again. She opens her arms and I go into them. She hugs me, and I hug her back. She\\u2019s not allowed to, but she does. This hug means everything. Back in G, I go straight to my bunk on the freeway and turn to the wall. I continue my prayer. I don\\u2019t know how I feel about God, so I pray to the universe. I pray to find my path, my purpose, my goodness, my soul. I pray for the strength and power and bravery I\\u2019ve given lip service to. I pray that whatever I need, I can find inside myself, because that\\u2019s all I have. I pray to the better version of me. I pray to the soul behind the ego, the brokenness, the fear. I pray to whom Eckhart Tolle calls the observer. The me that is watching me. I pray to Eckhart Tolle himself. I throw in Oprah because I know those two hang out a lot together. I spend the next three hours praying and visualizing a new life. I imagine writing about my experience. I imagine standing onstage talking about my mistakes. I imagine a home of sunlight and happy faces. I imagine my boys all sitting around the dinner table. I try not to think that Dylan will graduate high school in a few months and I won\\u2019t be there. That he will go off to college maybe before I even get out. I try not to think about the fact that our home is gone, my car has been repossessed, I don\\u2019t even have my driver\\u2019s license because I wasn\\u2019t out to pay an old ticket in November. I have lost my business. I have no job to support me or my boys or this imaginary place where we sit at a dinner table with sunlight streaming through the windows. I have destroyed everything. I have no idea what I will do when I walk out of jail in September, or where I will go, or if anyone will help me. Who would possibly hire the neighbor from hell? All these thoughts swirl in my head until I refocus and go back to prayer. The only solution is to never use drugs again. Today is March 18, 2009. My new birthday. I\\u2019m told to roll it up for Blaine Street a few days and many gallons of water later. I am nervous while I take the urine test, but I pass. I tell myself that this is the last drug test I\\u2019ll ever have to worry about since I\\u2019ll never use again. Blaine Street has its own kitchen and serves meals that are cooked in-house. Other luxuries include a sparse backyard with a dirt track around it, a badminton net, a small gym with an exercise bike and a treadmill. There is no freeway like in G, only four sets of dorm-style rooms on two levels. Each quad, as they\\u2019re called, is framed around a central dayroom with couches and chairs and its own television. There is a communal bathroom for each quad with actual stalls for privacy and porcelain sinks with mirrors and two genuine bathtubs. The bunk beds have real mattresses and even a pillow. There is a desk and a radio and a lamp. In Blaine we are given large T-shirt nightgowns to sleep in, and we get to change out our other clothes twice a week rather than twice a month. Blaine is the Ritz-Carlton compared to G. Volunteers come in after dinner each night and teach us to crochet or tell us about reentry services. There is a class on relapse prevention taught by a woman named Tracy who I instantly love. She\\u2019s direct and no-nonsense, and we hit it off immediately. There are even volunteers who will come in and do your hair. There\\u2019s a chaplain and religious services. A computer class if you need computer training. Music. Board games. And work. Lots of work. Each day you must clean your room before 7 a.m. Beds have to be made military style. Floors are mopped daily. Bathrooms cleaned. All are subject to inspection at 7 a.m. Once a week, on Sundays, it\\u2019s double scrub\\u2014in-depth cleaning, closets organized, every surface, knob, and wall scrubbed to perfection. Once the daily chores are done, the girls at Blaine Street go to the main jail to clean and cook for the entire facility\\u2014without them the jail would cease to function. I\\u2019m assigned to clean the public lobby of the main jail and the sheriff\\u2019s offices. I start work at 6 a.m. Only one deputy comes into the main office that early, and we chat it up every day. She calls her mom every morning, and after a couple of weeks she hands me the phone so I can say hello. Her mom always asks if I\\u2019m doing okay and staying out of trouble, and I assure her that I am. And I\\u2019ve let everyone know at Blaine Street I am not getting involved with anything shady. I know there are probably drugs waiting to be couriered under the tampon bags in the public stalls that I clean, but I don\\u2019t look. If anyone asks me to check, I tell them to fuck off. During my mornings emptying trash bags and cleaning bathrooms, I think about how much Blaine Street relies on women\\u2019s unpaid labor. If Blaine were empty, the jail would be in trouble. No meals. No cleaning. It\\u2019s a system completely disincentivized to rehabilitate people. Their business model doesn\\u2019t function without a high recidivism rate. If all the women in County were successful, exhibited good behavior, and became productive members of society, it would break the county budget. The sheriff\\u2019s department couldn\\u2019t afford hiring actual workers, so local taxes would get raised. People could barely afford the cost of living in Santa Cruz as it was, and proposing higher taxes rarely went well for local politicians regardless of the reason. Recidivism was the only financially viable path forward. The only way for the government to win is for the inmates to lose. It\\u2019s as simple as that. There\\u2019s an actual library at Blaine Street, and I read every volume. My new favorite is The Book of Awakening by Mark Nepo. It\\u2019s organized in daily dated essays, and I read it like a horoscope\\u2014looking for whatever wisdom I need to get through this particular day. It\\u2019s uncannily accurate. One of his observations resonates especially strongly with me: Pain pushes you until vision pulls you. After lights out, I lay in my bunk bed and try to trace my life back to the moment when I stopped letting a vision for my future pull me and started letting pain push. Because I did have a clear vision at one point. And it didn\\u2019t have anything to do with marriage or money or motherhood. From the time I first escaped into books, all I wanted was to be a writer. I was going to write novels that moved people, that helped them understand the world and themselves better. I wanted to make people feel, whether it was laughing or crying. And if the vision also had me rich and famous and fabulous, I was okay with that. Writing was always the only way for me to make sense of my childhood, my family, my fears, my emotions, my vast and confusing interior world. I was always a better version of me on the page. I was always at my most honest on the page. I could transcend every limitation I believed I had when I wrote. In high school I may have lived in a small apartment while my friends had big lawns but writing transcended class. Writing transcended loneliness. Writing transcended self-doubt and fear and heartbreak. I never needed a drink or a drug to write. When I took that first pill after Dylan was born, I stopped writing. I told myself it was having children, and financial troubles, and a difficult marriage that made writing impossible. I told myself there wasn\\u2019t enough time in the day to write. But all the excuses were lies. Opiates made writing impossible. The drugs I took to avoid pain kept me from the one thing that helped me cope with pain. Writing was my survival strategy and a bridge to other people. It gave me a sense of self-worth. It gave me joy. But mostly it was how I let feelings flow through me. Once I stopped writing, every bit of pain stayed in my body where it settled and weighed me down so much that the only way I could move through life at all was to take a pill as needed for pain. Then two. Then ten. Then twenty. Then sixty. And every time I tried to stop, tried to choose a life without something to dull the pain, I couldn\\u2019t stop for very long. I couldn\\u2019t stop long enough to realize what I really needed. I needed the writing. I start writing again. I write stories on the computer and print them out because we aren\\u2019t allowed to save documents. I write an essay about anger. There\\u2019s a woman in Blaine with the last name Doll who suffered horrible childhood abuse and I write a story about the million ways to break a doll. I read the story to Tracy, after relapse prevention class one night, and she sits in silence when I finish. \\u201cCan you please read that to me again?\\u201d she asks softly. I read her the story again. And then I read her my essay about anger. \\u201cThey\\u2019re so great,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI\\u2019m blown away. Can I take them to make copies?\\u201d Every day that I write, I feel vision pulling me. It\\u2019s not a clear vision, but there\\u2019s a tug. Writing not only passes the time, it makes me feel like I am me again. The old me. The real me. The me before the mess. Tracy brings back many copies of my anger essay, and it gets passed around Blaine Street. When Jacinda, a thirty-year-old who looks like she\\u2019s twelve, comes to me and asks if I can write her letter to the court asking if she can be moved from Blaine to a long-term residential treatment program, I\\u2019m not sure if I know enough to argue on her behalf for treatment. We sit on a bench in Blaine\\u2019s backyard, and I ask her why she wants to go to an eighteen-month treatment program rather than just do her six months at Blaine. \\u201cBecause I don\\u2019t want to come back here,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to go to treatment, but I need to go to treatment. Look, it\\u2019s eighteen months of structure and regular meals and therapy and support, but I\\u2019ll be safe there. You feel me?\\u201d Drawing on Eckhart Tolle\\u2019s advice, I stay as present as I can while Jacinda speaks. She tells me about her ex who always finds her, and her mom who died two years ago, and her sister who has been raising Jacinda\\u2019s son for so long that he thinks she\\u2019s his mother. I have to put my own desperation to get out of jail aside\\u2014I would never trade six months for eighteen months\\u2014and really listen to Jacinda. I try to see the world through her eyes, understand her backstory. It\\u2019s not pretty\\u2014one horrible foster home after another, running away from abuse, getting raped and kidnapped while high, getting locked up for the first time because she was crashing at a drug house that got raided. \\u201cOkay,\\u201d I say, after she\\u2019s shared her stories for over an hour. \\u201cI\\u2019ll write your letter.\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you want?\\u201d asks Jacinda. I always forget about the quid pro quo of jail friendship. I\\u2019m trying to cut my carbs, so I\\u2019m done trading things for bear claws. I fall silent as I ponder what else I could possibly want in this place. \\u201cI\\u2019ll make your bed every morning,\\u201d she says. \\u201cPlease\\u2026\\u201d I suck at making my bed. I can never get the corners as smooth and tight as the guards demand. I nod and smile in agreement. \\u201cAnd,\\u201d she adds, \\u201cif I get released because of your letter, I\\u2019ll make sure someone else makes your bed until you get out.\\u201d It\\u2019s a great incentive, but when I sit down to write the letter to the judge, I\\u2019m not thinking about my messy bed. I\\u2019m imagining that I am Jacinda and all she\\u2019s been through. I\\u2019m thinking about how many times I\\u2019ve been in and out of jail and how badly I want the structure of the residential program. I write a long letter imploring the judge to send me to treatment, to give me a fighting chance to never come back to jail. As Jacinda I end the letter with this: \\u201cI never had anyone care enough about me to tell me when to go to bed, to make sure I was eating healthy, to ask me how my day was. I want to follow the rules. In Santa Cruz Residential, they may not be my family but it will still be the closest thing I\\u2019ve ever had to a real home. Please let me go home. It\\u2019s all I\\u2019ve ever wanted.\\u201d Jacinda and I mail the letter, and for the next two weeks she makes my bed every morning before inspection. When the classification officer comes over from the main jail and asks for Jacinda, I go down to the lobby with her. He seems rushed and gives me a slightly annoyed look as I listen in on their conversation. He hands Jacinda a stack of paperwork. \\u201cYou get transferred tomorrow to treatment,\\u201d he says. \\u201cPack it up tonight. They are coming for you at six a.m.\\u201d Jacinda bursts into tears. \\u201cOkay then,\\u201d he says and walks away quickly. Jacinda and I look at each other, stunned. She throws her arms around me. \\u201cI\\u2019m so happy for you,\\u201d I say. \\u201cYou deserve this, you deserve a real chance.\\u201d \\u201cThank you,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how you did it, but what you wrote\\u2026 it was just everything I\\u2019ve ever felt and didn\\u2019t know how to say.\\u201d I hug her back tightly. There\\u2019s a feeling I don\\u2019t recognize that immediately overwhelms me and my eyes well up. I\\u2019m so happy for Jacinda but it\\u2019s something else. I\\u2019m proud of myself. And for the first time in a very long time, I feel good. I don\\u2019t see Jacinda the morning she leaves, but at 7 a.m. a quiet girl named Eve taps on my door and then walks in and makes my bed in silence. I try to ask Eve about herself, about what Jacinda traded her for, but she just smiles at me and shrugs. Whatever it is, she\\u2019s not saying. She comes every single morning before seven. When she\\u2019s not making my bed, Eve crochets all day, only breaking for meals. Her room is lined with hundreds of baby-sized caps and booties. The crochet volunteers collect them every month but where they take them is a mystery. I imagine a hospital or maybe the treatment center for pregnant women. After Jacinda, I have a steady job ghostwriting legal letters, love letters, birthday letters, anniversary poems, arguments in family disputes. I even write eulogies for two women who get passes to leave Blaine for funerals. I break up with a few gangsters, and I tell one poor schmuck I need a divorce because I\\u2019ve fallen in love with a woman and now have a jail wife. I prepare for each assignment the same way I did with Jacinda\\u2014by listening. Sometimes I worry I could get in trouble for pretending to be other people, especially since that\\u2019s what put me in jail in the first place. But I\\u2019m helping rather than hustling now, so I don\\u2019t worry too much about the fallout. I love pretending to be someone who isn\\u2019t me. All my years writing fiction help me to be a different character. When I talk to my clients at Blaine I listen for their particular quirks of language and phrasing, the way they tell a story. There are only a few judges in criminal court in Santa Cruz so I\\u2019m extra careful to vary the voice in each letter and match the voice to their individual backgrounds, education, and culture. The more letters I write, the easier it becomes to become another person. To think like they think. Reason like they reason. Occasionally I write how someone feels and they freak out because they didn\\u2019t tell me that they grew up never trusting other women, or that because they were abandoned by their father they always chose bad men just like him, but it\\u2019s true for them. It\\u2019s kind of spooky, and the girls whisper that I must be psychic. I don\\u2019t discourage their suspicion because it\\u2019s fun, it passes the time, and saves me from having to make my own bed. When I occasionally make a prediction about something entirely predictable that comes true, I gaze intently into people\\u2019s eyes as I deny that I\\u2019m psychic. And I don\\u2019t explain that the reason I can write so accurately about their fears, their shame, their desperation to be loved, to be better mothers than they had, or their struggles to stay clean, is because in all these ways we are exactly the same. I don\\u2019t yet realize that what I am doing is honing my empathy\\u2014the superpower of all great ghostwriters. \\n chapter 13 MOTHER\\u2019S DAY I get moved to kitchen duty at Blaine Street, and I get permission to grow a garden in the backyard. Each morning and night I work the soil, plant the seeds, tend to the vegetables that I will eventually cook and serve to my fellow inmates. I have never been a gardener, someone who loved to get her hands in the soil. But it\\u2019s different gardening in jail. Planting seeds feels hopeful and even the slow pace of vegetables growing feels exciting because there is something new being tended to and born. Soon after I plant the garden, Amy, Kaden\\u2019s CPS social worker, begins making plans to bring him for his first visit. I have called her every day since I got to Blaine. I am determined to do what I can from inside to get my boy back. Every week I ask her what I can do to move my case along. Rather than seeing her as a bureaucrat who wants to take Kaden away from me, I choose to treat her as my ally in getting him back. I choose to believe that the goal of everyone in CPS court is to return Kaden to me rather than take him away permanently. I try to manifest this into being, and I tell myself that the judge, the attorneys, the social workers are all working with me toward this goal. \\u201cWhat more can we do?\\u201d I ask them. \\u201cWhat more can I do?\\u201d I ask myself. This question becomes my mantra and consumes every waking hour. I slowly become an advocate for myself and for the other women going through similar CPS cases. One of the requirements to reunify within the allotted year is a positive-discipline parenting class. After I\\u2019m released, there will be no way I can complete this class within the one-year time frame. I lobby hard on behalf of all of us at Blaine and get an amazing woman, a former mayor of Santa Cruz, to come to Blaine Street and teach the class. Amy agrees to bring Kaden to a court-supervised visit once a week, but only if all the other girls in Blaine Street agree to stay in their rooms during the visit. It\\u2019s the only way CPS will allow the visits to count toward our reunification. All the girls agree to stay locked in their rooms. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s because of the letters I have written for them, or because so many of them have already lost children to the system, and they empathize with me. These women\\u2014mothers, sisters, friends\\u2014are rooting for Kaden. He is brought in for his first visit. We read books and play badminton. He sits on my lap, and I cuddle him and promise him I will be home soon, that we will be together. I walk him along the side yard so the girls can see his joy, which their sacrifice has made possible. He smiles and waves to them all and blows them sweet four-year-old kisses. I think it gives them hope. Because my new job in Blaine Street is running the kitchen, I can make him a snack like it\\u2019s our own kitchen. I make him hard-boiled eggs, which he loves to peel. I squirrel away boxes of Froot Loops so I can pour him a bowl of sweet cereal when he asks for it every week. I still worry that he hasn\\u2019t grown an inch since my arrest, so I feed him as much as I can. We work in the garden and talk about how each plant grows bigger just like him. I will him to grow. Each week he tries to leave something with me, a piece of clothing, a toy, his shoes. \\u201cI want to live here with you,\\u201d he begs. \\u201cPlease, Mommy.\\u201d \\u201cI love you, Boo Boo,\\u201d I tell him. \\u201cI wish you could live here, but it\\u2019s not allowed, plus your brothers would miss you.\\u201d He clings to my neck when it\\u2019s time to go, and I murmur \\u201csoon\\u201d as I rain kisses across his face until he laughs. I do my best not to show him my breaking heart. After he leaves, I grieve the loss all over again. When he cries to stay with me, I tell him Darcy and Bryan love him and are taking care of him for me. I want him to be happy wherever he is\\u2014and I do not say a negative word about Darcy, although he repeats cruel things she has said about me. I will never make him feel like his loyalty is divided or feel guilty for his happy moments away from me. I know I am his mom, and there is no ticking clock, or law, or judge, or social worker who can change that. DJ hasn\\u2019t yet made it to Rountree\\u2014the medium-security facility for men on the other side of the county. He has had no jailhouse epiphany like mine. If anything, jail is making him worse; he\\u2019s affiliating with gang members and doing drugs, and the jail stops allowing letters between us because he\\u2019s doodling gang symbols in them. When I ask the social worker what happens if both parents aren\\u2019t doing what they\\u2019re supposed to, she tells me the judge has the power to view each parent\\u2019s requirements separately and give custody back to one parent and not the other. \\u201cOf course,\\u201d she adds, \\u201cif you are living with the other parent and he is using drugs or hasn\\u2019t fulfilled his requirements, it would appear like you are not putting the well-being of the child first. Sometimes safety means there is only one parent in the picture.\\u201d I nod. Pain pushes and vision pulls. I\\u2019m done with pain. Officer Lonnie is the main deputy who works the day shift at Blaine Street. I am amazed that everyone calls her by her first name until I realize Lonnie is actually her last name. She is there from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. most days. Lonnie is about my age, with big brown eyes that can stare at you for an uncomfortable amount of time without blinking. She likes to think she doesn\\u2019t miss anything that happens at Blaine, but she does. She wears her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun. The guards don\\u2019t ever give out personal information, but from what I can gather, she is second generation from somewhere in Southeast Asia. When I get up at 5 a.m. to start cooking for the thirty residents of Blaine she offers me coffee. Real coffee. Guard coffee. She finds the fact that I\\u2019ve never tried pho more offensive than my felonies. She tells me how her various relatives make pho, what they each put in it, the five main spices, and how the pho at the diner nearby compares. She also shares the latest Hollywood gossip with me in hopes I will share the latest Blaine Street gossip with her. One day I ask Lonnie if I can make banana bread as a treat for the women of Blaine. I hand her a list of ingredients I will need. As a working mom, I never had time to bake and garden like I do at Blaine. I always thought of baking and gardening as luxuries of the idle or unambitious, but I was wrong. There is something about growing things and feeding people that makes my soul feel good again. I wish I had gardened and baked more when I had a home of my own. \\u201cWhat do you have to offer?\\u201d asks Lonnie. It\\u2019s not as creepy a question as it sounds. Lonnie is trying to move up in the corrections department, and the more contraband she can confiscate from inmates the better it is for her career. Confiscating involves a lot of work for her and a lot of stress for the residents of Blaine, so Lonnie and I have worked out a system: I collect contraband for her so that nobody gets in trouble and in exchange she brings in treats. It\\u2019s a win-win, no-fuss-no-muss system for everyone. \\u201cWhat do you want?\\u201d I counter. \\u201cTwo lighters,\\u201d she says. Lighters are a coup in the guard confiscation world, since they are needed to smoke cigarettes or drugs, and they can also start fires. I come back with an offer of one lighter, and the deal is done. There are lots of lighters at Blaine, so it\\u2019s easy to get a volunteer to give one up for the possibility of banana bread. When I ask for two DVDs and cake mix and frosting, we have a harder negotiation. She wants three lighters and a pack of cigarettes. We settle on two lighters and five cigarettes in exchange for a full movie night experience for Blaine Street where we can stay up until midnight. We are drinking our morning coffee when I finally get up the nerve to ask her about going to the Gemma Program\\u2014an eight-week reentry program where about ten Blaine Street residents get to leave in street clothes two days a week and take classes at a local church in relapse prevention, nutritious cooking, music, yoga, r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 writing, and life skills like how to balance a checkbook. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to do it,\\u201d I say. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t really need it,\\u201d says Lonnie. \\u201cPlease!\\u201d I beg. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not up to me. You have to meet with Cassandra, she\\u2019s the program director. She\\u2019s coming to do interviews tomorrow for the new session. I just refer people to her that I think can be trusted and who will benefit from it, but it\\u2019s her decision.\\u201d \\u201cWill you refer me?\\u201d She says nothing, just smirks at me between sips of her coffee. \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t think I can be trusted?\\u201d I ask this lightly, but my voice shakes a little. It hurts. I want people to trust me again. Lonnie sets her coffee down and laughs. \\u201cI already referred you.\\u201d Lonnie doesn\\u2019t show much emotion, nor is she moved by others\\u2019 emotions. But she does have compassion, and I\\u2019m grateful to her. Cassandra pulls me out to the lobby to interview me. She\\u2019s a large Black woman who exudes joy from her purple-glitter eye shadow to her flower nose ring to her colorful flowing scarves. I\\u2019m afraid she\\u2019s seen the newspaper headline and read the online comments. I read them constantly, trying to figure out the identity of each username. I know which comment is from Darcy. I know which are from people in recovery. I know which name is an old boss. But the bulk of the comments seem to be from strangers\\u2014people who read the article and have a lot to say about who I am and what I\\u2019ve done. It\\u2019s almost like reading your horoscope every day and trying to see yourself in the description\\u2014if your horoscope threatened you and called you a sociopath. Reading them is like poking at a wound that\\u2019s trying to heal. They are the opposite of positive affirmations, but I can\\u2019t seem to stop. Cassandra and I chat for twenty minutes as she tells me about the program, the classes. She asks me why I want to attend and I don\\u2019t bullshit her. \\u201cI really want to leave here twice a week,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to lie about that. But I also love school, learning, and homework. I want something to focus on besides cooking and cleaning and waiting for visits from my boys.\\u201d \\u201cI think you\\u2019ll make a great addition to the Gemma Program,\\u201d Cassandra tells me. She has the kindest smile I have ever seen, and she beams it at me as if I am worthy of such kindness. \\u201cBut\\u2026\\u201d I stammer, \\u201cI just want you to know\\u2026\\u201d She looks at me expectantly, still smiling. I don\\u2019t know how to say what I want to say. I feel inarticulate and like I need to make sure she knows what she\\u2019s getting into so that she doesn\\u2019t regret offering me a place. \\u201cThere was this headline,\\u201d I begin. \\u201cI have thirty-two felonies, and I just want to make sure you know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m really, I mean everyone thinks I\\u2019m really\\u2026\\u201d I finally blurt it out. \\u201cI\\u2019m a bad person!\\u201d Cassandra tilts her head and stares me straight in the eye. The kindness and warmth don\\u2019t leave her face. What I say doesn\\u2019t seem to shock her, but she doesn\\u2019t speak for a good thirty seconds. \\u201cMy son was in the paper once. I\\u2019ll tell you about it someday, but meanwhile I\\u2019ll be here at seven a.m. on Tuesday to pick you up,\\u201d she finally says. I nod and thank her. As I stand up, she hugs me. Lonnie, watching from the guard station, doesn\\u2019t stop her. Lara the mom gets hugged and cuddled by Kaden every week. But Lara, the neighbor from hell, has never been hugged like this. I fold into her and rest my head on her broad shoulder. Her perfume is sweet. I want to stay here forever. She murmurs \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be okay\\u2026\\u201d over and over, and we stay like that for a few minutes. In Cassandra\\u2019s arms, I feel like I am good. The Gemma classes are taught by local volunteers, and the church gives access to the meeting room and the kitchen for free. A few weeks into the session I find out some girls have been stealing money from the collection box at the church. I put a stop to it right away, making them return what they stole and confess to Cassandra. When they protest, I remind them that I control the Blaine Street kitchen, which also means I control the cheese. In relapse prevention someone said that there\\u2019s a chemical in cheese that\\u2019s identical to one in heroin. I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s true, but I do know that in Blaine whoever controls the cheese controls the women. Halfway through the program, Alice, a volunteer, gives us homework where we have to list all the pros and cons of restorative justice versus punitive justice. Back at Blaine, we all gather in the computer room and talk about what it would be like to sit in a circle with the people we have harmed and hear their experience of our crimes. Some girls say they\\u2019d prefer a judge to facing their victims, and I think about sitting with my neighbors and trying to explain why I stole their checkbook and wrote a check at the grocery store. Or why I used their social security number to get credit to buy a Kindle. I don\\u2019t know if I could explain it in a way that wouldn\\u2019t sound like I wasn\\u2019t taking responsibility. \\u201cI was out of my mind\\u201d doesn\\u2019t cut it. \\u201cI just wanted to read parenting e-books\\u201d makes me sound inane. I didn\\u2019t want to hurt them. But my life for the last year was like driving at night in heavy fog; I could only focus on a foot in front of me. I had no peripheral vision for anyone or anything else. I definitely couldn\\u2019t see my neighbors. I can\\u2019t imagine one person who was in the courtroom when I was sentenced choosing forgiveness over punishment. I don\\u2019t think I could make that choice if someone hurt my family, violated my sense of safety and security. Restorative justice was great in theory but we Gemma girls couldn\\u2019t imagine forgiving ourselves, much less asking others to forgive us. I am the fastest typist in Blaine, so I help all the girls type up their homework and print it for class. At the next class, Alice and I are sitting across from each other, at two ends of a large conference table. The rest of the girls are on either side. \\u201cDid anyone have any problems with typing it up?\\u201d she asks. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay if you had to handwrite it.\\u201d \\u201cI helped everyone type it on the computer,\\u201d I say brightly. The weeks are flying by now, and I\\u2019m in great spirits. Tracy, the relapse prevention teacher, had challenged me to stop reading the newspaper comments about me so I have, and it\\u2019s lifted my mood considerably. I smile at Alice, but she doesn\\u2019t smile back. She says sharply, \\u201cI\\u2019m not comfortable with you being on any kind of computer at all.\\u201d My stomach flips, and I study Alice more closely to see if I know her from anywhere outside Gemma, Little League or Montessori maybe, but she just glares at me with open disdain. Nobody says anything. One of the rules of Gemma is that you never talk about anyone\\u2019s crimes. The volunteers are there to help and support us because they believe in reentry and rehabilitation. Like our homework assignment, Gemma itself is based on restorative justice, not punitive. I can\\u2019t respond, and my cheeks burn. I keep my eyes on the table for the rest of the class. When the day is over, and we are putting chairs away in the supply closet, I step inside and start to cry. I feel defeated. Ashamed. I silently berate myself for my optimism. If a Gemma volunteer has such vitriol toward me, then I have no chance out in the world. Cassandra pushes her way into the closet. She\\u2019s livid. \\u201cShe had no right to say that to you,\\u201d she says angrily. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to talk to her.\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t come back,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the point? I\\u2019m done.\\u201d I have no anger in me like Cassandra does, but then anger has always come out as sadness for me. \\u201cYou will be back. You\\u2019ll be back on Thursday, and you\\u2019ll be back every week after until you graduate. I promise you, nothing like that will happen again.\\u201d I shrug and tell Cassandra I\\u2019ll think about it. When I walk into Blaine, Lonnie takes one look at me and says, \\u201cWho died?\\u201d I tell her what happened. \\u201cSo your feelings got hurt,\\u201d she says. \\u201cDo you like Gemma?\\u201d \\u201cYeah\\u2026 but\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cThen get over it. Show up and hold your head up.\\u201d \\u201cBut\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cOr no more getting out of double-scrub by having your minions do your job.\\u201d This makes me laugh. Lonnie always knows more than I give her credit for. \\u201cHow about some ice cream for the girls? Ice cream always cheers me up. I like vanilla.\\u201d \\u201cFigures you like vanilla. No deal. You don\\u2019t get rewarded for pouting, so suck it up, Love. And finish what you started.\\u201d Lonnie\\u2019s right. I want to finish Gemma, so I will. Later that night Lonnie calls me to her window and hands me the office phone. It\\u2019s Cassandra. \\u201cI spoke to her. Apparently she\\u2019s friends with your next-door neighbor.\\u201d \\u201cOh, great\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIt won\\u2019t happen again,\\u201d says Cassandra. \\u201cNot on my watch. And you don\\u2019t have to do her class anymore. And she won\\u2019t be coming back next session.\\u201d \\u201cThanks,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI guess I\\u2019ll see you Thursday.\\u201d \\u201cYou bet your ass you will.\\u201d On Mother\\u2019s Day, Bryan brings Dylan, Cody, and Ty to visit. It\\u2019s always awkward to see Bryan, and even more awkward when he keeps telling me how good I look. \\u201cI mean, you look so healthy,\\u201d he adds. It\\u2019s true. I exercise every day, I meditate, I go to bed early, I have lots of friends. But mostly I feel hopeful. At first it felt like I would be in jail forever, but now I see an advertisement for a movie coming out in October and I think, I will be out of jail when that movie premieres. The boys and I sit in Blaine\\u2019s backyard and talk. I tell them stories about the other girls, silly fights people get in, how we trade lighters for cake mix, and I give them the beanies I have crocheted for them. \\u201cI got into Cal Poly,\\u201d says Dylan. I scream and hug him. My firstborn is headed for college. \\u201cI\\u2019m so proud of you,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWhen does school start?\\u201d \\u201cThe end of September.\\u201d I will be out, I think. I will be out of jail to see him off to college. Cody talks about basketball and his new girlfriend. Ty talks about his friends in junior high and the academic awards he\\u2019s winning even though he skips classes whenever he can. \\u201cI believe in cutting out the middleman,\\u201d he says. I look at him, puzzled. \\u201cThe teacher.\\u201d He laughs. \\u201cI don\\u2019t need the teacher to learn or to do well on the tests.\\u201d The old me would have freaked out on him, told him he can\\u2019t skip school and that teachers are important. The new me just listens and understands. Because it\\u2019s Mother\\u2019s Day there\\u2019s no time limit on the visits, and the boys and Bryan stay all day. We play badminton and check out the garden, but mostly we just sit and talk and laugh. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been writing,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI\\u2019ve missed it so much. I don\\u2019t know why I stopped writing.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t stop, Mom,\\u201d they say. \\u201cYou should do what you love.\\u201d Sitting in the shade under a tree outside the jail with my boys should feel weird and painful and awkward. But there\\u2019s so much love between us under that tree that I realize I didn\\u2019t need all those trappings to prove I was a loving mom. I didn\\u2019t need a big house and a big car and private school and fancy vacations. None of that mattered or matters. I realize in this moment that I am a better mom in jail than I have ever been outside jail. Our conversations feel more real, more raw, more honest. We\\u2019re not fitting into any preconceived roles\\u2014we can\\u2019t. I used to think the most important thing was that my boys get into Stanford, or some big Ivy League college like Harvard, but now I realize it\\u2019s not that important. Dylan is happy to be going to Cal Poly, so I\\u2019m happy. If he\\u2019d told me he decided not to go to college, I would have still been happy. Bryan and I aren\\u2019t fighting, and every time one of the boys says something funny our eyes meet in shared understanding: We did this. As flawed and fucked-up as we were, we created these beautiful humans. The Love boys have always had each other, but now, thanks to my arrest, they have their mom back. I\\u2019m not keeping secrets. I\\u2019m not pretending. I\\u2019m just here in my green and purple loving on them. I never thought I would be overwhelmed with gratitude spending Mother\\u2019s Day in jail, but I am. Thank you. I am alive. Thank you. I am their mother. Thank you, thank you, thank you. A few weeks later, we have a Gemma graduation at a hotel near the courthouse. We are given graduation gowns. We are each expected to give a speech. Friends and family, judges and attorneys and city officials, and even some guards attend the ceremony. I invite my sons, but only Dylan and Cody can make it. For many of the girls, this will be the only graduation they\\u2019ll ever have. I have graduated high school and college and graduate school, but I feel most proud of this commencement. It feels like a celebration. When we come out to begin the ceremony, we all dance out one by one to \\u201cSuperwoman\\u201d by Alicia Keys. It should have been embarrassing for all of us, in our maroon caps and gowns, swaying and dancing and celebrating because we graduated from a basic life skills program. The audience of judges and guards is slightly uncomfortable, and my boys are mortified, but our dancing is an act of rebellion. Who are we to celebrate? Who are we to laugh and smile? Who are we to wear our caps and gowns proudly and share our speeches with confidence? Who are we to identify as Superwomen? We are women full of possibility and hope. In my speech, I talk about the experience of time in jail. I talk about how I used to treat time as a limitless resource, and not the precious and rare commodity it actually is. I try to convey how often the past is present when you have only your own mind for company, and how the future is unknown. I talk about the obstacles we all will face when we are released. I talk about pain pushing and vision pulling. I talk about missing Dylan\\u2019s high school graduation the week earlier but how he is here to see me graduate, and I ask the audience to cheer for him. And then I promise my boys, the guards, the judge on my case who is watching, that I will never miss another graduation of any of my children. My old boyfriend, the district attorney, is at the graduation. Cassandra is flabbergasted because he has never attended one of these ceremonies before. I see him watching me dance, staring at me intently while I give my speech. He gets up to leave when the reception is about to begin, and I track his movements to the door. He turns around at the doorway and our eyes meet. He smiles. I smile. In this small moment we are friends again. We are on the same side. It\\u2019s a long summer without Gemma to break up the monotony, but I work in the garden, and Lonnie lets me do landscaping in the evenings in front of Blaine Street. I am always working during shift change at 7 p.m., so the main jail guards all see me out front with no locked doors between me and the outside world. Some have started to wave to me every evening, others just frown and look concerned. I love these evenings of freedom\\u2014pruning rosebushes, pulling weeds. Plants never judge you. Some nights, I almost think I can hear the summer sounds of people laughing at the nearby beach. I think of all the times I took my boys there\\u2014riding the baby rides on the boardwalk until they were big enough to go on the Giant Dipper roller coaster. Kaden would still be on the baby rides, and I imagine us eating cotton candy and playing carnival games together. On nights when the summer fog rolls in, it makes me moody and nostalgic for everything I have lost. I don\\u2019t want to cook dinner for thirty women; I want to cook dinner for my family. I don\\u2019t want to mop jail floors; I want to mop a floor in my own house. I don\\u2019t want to prune the jail\\u2019s rosebushes; I want to plant my own garden in my own backyard. Each night I go to sleep thinking I am one day closer to all these things. And each morning I wake up not knowing how the hell I\\u2019m going to make any of that happen. At the end of June Michael Jackson dies. Lonnie and I discuss his demise over coffee. It\\u2019s got to be opiates, I tell her. I\\u2019m pretty sure he was an opiate addict. Lonnie disagrees, and we fall into a heated debate. In July, reports emerge about his history of abusing pain medication. Even though she runs a jail filled with women who suffer from substance abuse disorders, Lonnie still doesn\\u2019t understand how someone who has everything can throw it all away. Such behavior doesn\\u2019t fit her no-nonsense, deal-with-it mentality, so I try to explain how the drugs just take over. How they make nothing else matter. \\u201cBut you know what you\\u2019re doing,\\u201d she says. \\u201cYou still know right from wrong.\\u201d \\u201cOf course,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThen if you know you are doing the wrong things,\\u201d she says, giving me a pointed look, \\u201cthen you should know enough to stop.\\u201d \\u201cIt just doesn\\u2019t work that way,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWell then you ask for help\\u2026\\u201d I think about all the times I could have asked for help and didn\\u2019t. In my mind, there was no way I could ever be away from my children for the thirty days it took to go to rehab. It feels ironic now that I\\u2019ve been away from them for nine months. \\u201cThere\\u2019s so much stigma and shame,\\u201d I say. \\u201cFor me, it would have meant admitting that I didn\\u2019t have my shit together. I was afraid of being judged. Seems like a small price to pay now. I was super invested in pretending like everything was fine, and I was the perfect mom. Perfect moms don\\u2019t go to rehab.\\u201d \\u201cSo how\\u2019d that work out for you?\\u201d Lonnie asks. \\u201cAnd you still knew right from wrong when you were out there committing all those felonies.\\u201d I think about it for a minute. \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t that I forgot right from wrong,\\u201d I say. \\u201cDrugs don\\u2019t do that, at least not for me. But they did make me forget who I was, if that makes sense. I didn\\u2019t forget the law, I forgot myself.\\u201d \\u201cWhat does that mean?\\u201d \\u201cIt means I forgot that I\\u2019m someone who would give you everything I have before I\\u2019d ever steal from you. It means I forgot that I\\u2019m someone who\\u2019s happy and fun and likes people. I forgot that I\\u2019m creative and loving and careful and thoughtful and generous.\\u201d \\u201cYou didn\\u2019t seem to forget that you\\u2019re full of yourself.\\u201d Lonnie laughs. \\u201cBut I did,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI completely forgot to be full of myself. But mostly I forgot I\\u2019m someone who wants to live.\\u201d Lonnie clears her throat. \\u201cAre you going to cry?\\u201d I ask. Lonnie scoffs. \\u201cYou wish.\\u201d In August, the jail announces plans for an early-release program to help with overcrowding. They are going to release some inmates ahead of their official out date, but you have to come back to the jail every day from eight to four and work. There\\u2019s lots of excitement about this program, but it only reminds me yet again how much the county depends on women\\u2019s unpaid labor. Soon after this plan is floated, Lonnie calls me over the loudspeaker on a Friday before shift change. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d I say. \\u201cI was just looking up your husband\\u2019s record on the computer. He was caught with street clothes under his mattress.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d DJ and I haven\\u2019t been able to write each other in months, and since we\\u2019re done with court dates, I never see him. Or think about him. I declared my love for him in my letters, but I didn\\u2019t really feel anything for him anymore. I didn\\u2019t hate him; I didn\\u2019t love him. And I didn\\u2019t know what to do about it. Lonnie reads through the reports on DJ. \\u201cWow, he\\u2019s had a lot of trouble in jail. I shouldn\\u2019t be sharing this with you, but I want you to know\\u2014you guys seem like you\\u2019re on different trajectories.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what to say to this, so I just shrug. I don\\u2019t know if this is Lonnie my friend advising me about my future, or Lonnie my jailer scouting for information. \\u201cYou should get rid of this guy, that\\u2019s all I\\u2019m saying.\\u201d \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s not like we\\u2019re dating right now.\\u201d I laugh, but Lonnie is stone-faced. \\u201cYou qualify for early release with the new program. You are out on Monday morning.\\u201d I am surprised. I thought I had another three weeks. I have no idea where I\\u2019m going to live or how I\\u2019m going to get to the jail to work each day. The jail doesn\\u2019t care about these challenges, and for now neither do I. With freedom so close, it\\u2019s hard to think about how hard homelessness will be. \\u201cI\\u2019m not working this weekend, so this is goodbye,\\u201d she says. Lonnie and I look at each other. I can\\u2019t tell her that I\\u2019ll miss her because that\\u2019s just awkward given our circumstances. But I appreciate her, and I will miss her friendship. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to see you again,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI promise I will never be back here. I will never go to jail again. No offense.\\u201d \\u201cDo you know how many times I\\u2019ve been told that, and then two months later I see the person right back here again?\\u201d \\u201cA million times?\\u201d \\u201cProbably more. I think you might have a chance\\u2014but you need to get rid of the guy. Everyone here thinks so. And if you come back, I will not let you have your own room. I will bunk you up with the most obnoxious person in here.\\u201d \\u201cDeal,\\u201d I reply. \\u201cBut what do you mean by \\u2018everyone\\u2019 thinks so?\\u201d Lonnie laughs. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t think the guards talk as much about you guys as you do about us?\\u201d When shift change happens, I am outside tending to the roses. Lonnie drives past and yells out her window, \\u201cTry some pho!\\u201d I give her a little wave and go back to deadheading the rosebushes so that the tender new buds have room to grow. I don\\u2019t tell anyone I\\u2019m leaving on Monday. The few days before someone\\u2019s out date are always precarious. Sometimes girls sabotage themselves and get into trouble that requires them to stay, and other times another inmate sabotages them. Like any place where thirty women are living on top of each other, each dealing with their own trauma, their own sobriety, their own regret\\u2014it can be all kumbaya and girl power until it isn\\u2019t. I have nightmares all weekend before my release\\u2014where I\\u2019m running because I\\u2019m being chased, or I\\u2019m trying to save my children and I can\\u2019t. I know that I\\u2019m walking out of Blaine a different person than I was when I walked in\\u2014but I don\\u2019t know exactly who I am now. I have been so many different versions of myself that I don\\u2019t know which is real. All of them? None of them? On Sunday night, right before lights out, I tell everyone I am leaving in the morning, and we have a spontaneous dance party in our quad. Janelle and Mandi help me fold the blanket I have made in crochet class over the last few months. I want to give it to Dylan to take to Cal Poly when he leaves in September. I\\u2019ve missed almost his whole senior year of high school. His football games and SATs and prom and graduation. I have missed my oldest son\\u2019s most important year of school, and the guilt is all-consuming. In my fantasy life I imagine being back in a home with all my boys, but I realize that because Dylan is going off to college he will probably never live with me again. This realization that some things are just lost to me forever is like jumping into icy waters. It takes my breath away. I shake off the cold reality and focus on my last night with my Blaine Street family. The blanket that I have been blindly crocheting during my months at Blaine has grown to be at least twenty feet long and ten feet wide, and the folding party devolves into dark hilarity. \\u201cAt least you\\u2019ll have something to keep you warm when you\\u2019re homeless.\\u201d \\u201cYou could cut it up and have an entire crocheted wardrobe.\\u201d \\u201cYou can hide under it when Probation comes knocking.\\u201d At one point, all thirty of us try to fit under the blanket like it\\u2019s a fort. It\\u2019s all fun and games until Janelle pees her pants from laughing so hard. I go to bed that night smiling, hopeful, sure that the hard part is out of the way. I have done my time. On August 17, 2009, I walk out of Blaine Street forever. When I leave Blaine, I must go immediately to the probation department to let them know my address and get the terms of my release. I have no address, only a prepaid room in a seedy motel called the Hitching Post not far from the jail, where I will spend the next few weeks. An uncle I haven\\u2019t seen or heard from in years has offered to pay for this, my mom tells me. I am grateful, but also hurt that no relative of mine ever wrote or visited me in jail. I know that part of my sentence is attending drug court once I\\u2019m released, but I don\\u2019t know when or how this starts. Drug court is usually an alternative to jail that involves night classes twice a week, random drug testing, immediate incarceration for a weekend if there\\u2019s a failed drug test, and the promise of a clean record upon completion of the program. Drug testing is also part of probation, and part of the CPS reunification requirements. Every day I must call three different numbers and see if any of them requires me to get a drug test. I will have three hours to get the test from the time I am alerted. Meeting all the CPS requirements is a condition of my criminal case plea deal; meeting my drug court requirements is a condition of the CPS case; and doing whatever Probation wants trumps all. The various parts of the system are precariously stacked like a Jenga tower. Make one wrong move and it all comes toppling down. I will walk out of Blaine with no car, no phone, no friends, and no idea how to navigate the confusing and conflicting requirements of three different parts of the same system. It feels like a setup because failure at anything means I\\u2019m back in jail on a probation violation. The early-release program also means I report to the jail every morning at eight to do yardwork and landscaping. When I leave Blaine, my mom is waiting outside and takes me to breakfast. She has made the hour-and-a-half drive from her home in San Francisco, and I hope that she will stay longer, but after breakfast she drops me off at the probation department and leaves. I give the woman at the front desk my name, and she looks at me blankly. \\u201cI just got out of jail,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThey told me to come here and report in or get oriented or something. I have to do it within seventy-two hours, but I\\u2019m here today.\\u201d The woman has me wait in the lobby for over two hours and then finally the probation officer on duty comes out. \\u201cYou\\u2019re here too soon,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have any paperwork from the jail yet. Come back in a few days.\\u201d \\u201cBut I\\u2019m on the new work-release program and I have to be at the jail working from eight to four starting tomorrow. You guys aren\\u2019t open before eight or after four.\\u201d \\u201cWhat\\u2019s your name again?\\u201d I tell him and then he has me follow him back to his desk. He gets on his computer. \\u201cYou just got out?\\u201d \\u201cA few hours ago,\\u201d I say. \\u201cYeah, we\\u2019ve already had a call about a probation violation. You need to appear in criminal court, Department Three, at eight tomorrow morning. And drug court is at three on Fridays.\\u201d \\u201cWhat did I do? What probation violation?\\u201d I am shocked. \\u201cI\\u2019m not your probation officer, you\\u2019ll get assigned one once we get your paperwork. But you need to be in court tomorrow morning.\\u201d \\u201cI have to be working at the jail at eight,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI just got out. I haven\\u2019t done anything wrong.\\u201d He just shrugs. \\u201cHow,\\u201d I ask him, \\u201cam I supposed to be in both places at once? What do I do? And drug court is at three but I\\u2019m supposed to do work release until four.\\u201d \\u201cNot our problem,\\u201d he says. \\u201cBut if you don\\u2019t show up in court that\\u2019s another probation violation.\\u201d I walk outside and sit on the front steps of the building. My body starts to shake, and I\\u2019m hyperventilating. The busy street in front of me narrows in my vision like I\\u2019m looking at it through a telescope. I watch the people passing by in their cars\\u2014running errands, going to work, getting lunch, driving their kids to and from activities. I bury my face in my hands and cry. I imagine throwing myself into the street, not to die, just to get injured, so a hospital will take me in, and nurses will take care of me. I think about all the girls in the main jail who were released one day and then booked back in the next day for stealing, or fighting, or trespassing, or public drunkenness. One mother and daughter who were in G and then Blaine at the same time used to joke that it was the best home they ever had together. Only they weren\\u2019t joking. I always questioned how they could be so stupid to land back in jail so soon, and now I know. Alone on the outside makes together on the inside feel safer. I sit there for an hour, and then I wipe my eyes and make a plan. First, back to the jail to tell them I have to be in court in the morning, then I will walk to my public defender\\u2019s office. I don\\u2019t know if she\\u2019s done with her maternity leave or even still my attorney now that I\\u2019m out, but she\\u2019s the only one who might take my side and tell me what I should do. DJ won\\u2019t be released for a few weeks at least, and I know that if I can survive until then, my mother-in-law will help us find somewhere to live. Maybe lend us a car. I just have to take the first step. And then another. And then another. My attorney isn\\u2019t in, but the receptionist tells me that Elizabeth will meet me at court in the morning and to get there fifteen minutes early so we can talk. \\u201cDo you know what it\\u2019s about?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cDo you know who called?\\u201d \\u201cI have no idea, sorry.\\u201d That night I triple-lock myself into my room at the Hitching Post. Every surface is both greasy and dusty. No double-scrub here, I think. I only have the forty dollars that my mom put on my books so the jail would give me some cash when I was released, and I don\\u2019t know how long that has to last. I don\\u2019t have clothes for court. I don\\u2019t know what I could already be in trouble for. How can I violate probation before I\\u2019m even signed up for it? I consciously try to stay awake because I don\\u2019t want to have nightmares in this strange place. Twenty-four hours ago, I was laughing and hopeful. Now I feel like prey. \\n chapter 14 ALL BUSES LEAD TO THE SAME PLACE Elizabeth meets me at 8 a.m. in front of the courthouse. She is noticeably not pregnant, but we don\\u2019t have time to chat about newborns, sleep schedules, breastfeeding, or any of the other experiences I would normally discuss with a new mother. \\u201cSomeone called Probation a half hour after you were released,\\u201d she says, \\u201cand said you violated CPS terms.\\u201d \\u201cWhat did I do?\\u201d I ask in panic. \\u201cI was at the jail, went to breakfast, then Probation, then back to the jail, then went to your office.\\u201d \\u201cThe caller said you were seen driving by Kaden\\u2019s daycare. The caller knew that following CPS requirements is a part of your probation.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t even have a car.\\u201d Obviously, the person didn\\u2019t know that. \\u201cI haven\\u2019t even talked to anyone. I don\\u2019t have a phone or a car or a way to reach my boys to tell them I\\u2019m out. I wouldn\\u2019t do that.\\u201d I\\u2019m begging her, but I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m begging her for. To believe me? To fight for me? My voice sounds high-pitched and shaky in my own ears. If I didn\\u2019t know me better, I would think I was lying. \\u201cWho would make up something like that? Why would someone do that?\\u201d Elizabeth pats my shoulder. \\u201cLook, anyone can make up anything and tell it to Probation. It happens all the time. People want revenge, or they just want to cause trouble for people when they get out of jail. They file false CPS reports. They file false probation violation reports. They make accusations.\\u201d My mind jumps through all the possibilities. I don\\u2019t want to think Darcy would stoop so low, but while I\\u2019ll never know, she\\u2019s my most likely candidate. I want to scream. I want to cry. I don\\u2019t want to go back to jail. \\u201cI would be on camera outside the jail,\\u201d I say frantically. \\u201cDo they have cameras at Probation? I can prove I didn\\u2019t go anywhere else but the main jail, breakfast, Probation, back to the main jail, and then to your office. I was in the lobby at the jail. I talked to the deputy on duty at the window. I can prove it! There will be a receipt from breakfast!\\u201d I\\u2019m angry, but my anger comes out as tears. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to go talk to the judge. I know you didn\\u2019t drive by daycare. Sit in the courtroom and wait for me to call you up.\\u201d I follow her inside and sit near the door. A part of me wants to run. I\\u2019m going to be one of those girls who go back to jail the next day. The judge walks in, and I meet his eye. It\\u2019s Judge Marigonda, the same judge who sentenced me. Elizabeth, the assistant district attorney, and the probation officer all approach the bench. I can\\u2019t hear what they are saying, but at times they all glance in my direction. I eye the bailiff nervously. I\\u2019ve done nothing wrong, but I feel guilty and stare with mounting dread at the handcuffs on his belt. After about fifteen minutes, the ADA and probation officer go back to their table, and Elizabeth waves me up. \\u201cMs. Love,\\u201d the judge acknowledges me. My mouth is too dry to speak so I just nod. \\u201cMs. Love, we understand you have been released early for good behavior and as part of the work-release program.\\u201d \\u201cYes, Your Honor.\\u201d My voice is small and weak. \\u201cMs. Love, we have decided to modify your sentence.\\u201d I look over at my attorney desperately and take a big inhale to speak, but she shakes her head at me and smiles at the judge. \\u201cWe are going to take you out of drug court and send you to Family Preservation Court. You have probation requirements and requirements from the CPS court and will also have requirements from Family Preservation Court. I want to see you in my courtroom the morning after every appearance you have in Family Preservation Court. Commissioner Siegel oversees that court, so I will be getting updates from him directly on your progress. If you mess up, you will be remanded. Is that clear?\\u201d I nod. \\u201cI need a verbal answer, Ms. Love.\\u201d \\u201cYes, Your Honor.\\u201d \\u201cI saw you walking to Probation yesterday as I was driving to the courthouse,\\u201d the judge adds. I nod again. \\u201cI saw with my own eyes that you didn\\u2019t have a car, nor were you driving by a daycare at the same time I was driving by you. You have a big uphill battle in front of you, Ms. Love, but I trust you are up to the task. I was also happy to see you at the Gemma graduation. We\\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of each other now.\\u201d I swallow nervously. \\u201cThank you, Your Honor,\\u201d my attorney says. I mumble \\u201cThank you\\u201d and turn toward the door. \\u201cWait for me outside,\\u201d Elizabeth whispers. In the hallway I blink at the bright lights, not sure what has just transpired. When Elizabeth emerges from the courtroom, she pulls me to a quiet area in the hall where her husband, Jonathan, joins us. I haven\\u2019t seen him since my sentencing. \\u201cThey know the call was a fake,\\u201d says Jonathan. \\u201cSo you don\\u2019t have to worry.\\u201d \\u201cBut what about the next call?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cCan anyone just call Probation and lie about me?\\u201d My freedom, so newly won, feels fragile. What a fool I was to believe that I only had to do the right thing and it would all be okay. Elizabeth and Jonathan have no answer for me. \\u201cWhat is Family Preservation Court?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cAnd why did I get moved there?\\u201d \\u201cLook, your husband is going to be out in a few weeks,\\u201d says Elizabeth. \\u201cThe court and Probation want to separate you from him. He will be in drug court, and you will go to Family Preservation Court, which includes outpatient treatment at night, testing, and court appearances on your progress, with the CPS attorneys and social workers in attendance. It\\u2019s a good thing. It\\u2019s a reward. It will help you get your son back sooner.\\u201d \\u201cBut what about getting my record cleared and getting off probation when I finish and all the other benefits of drug court?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cWill I lose those?\\u201d \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re not being punished. They want you to succeed. And they think you\\u2019ll have a better chance of succeeding if you\\u2019re in a different program from your husband. Although I\\u2019ve never heard of a criminal court wanting you to appear every time you have Family Preservation Court. Marigonda really wants to be able to lock you up if you relapse, like they do in drug court.\\u201d \\u201cWill you be there in criminal court with me?\\u201d I don\\u2019t understand how probation works or if public defenders are still your defenders after you get out of jail. \\u201cOne of us will be there. We represent you.\\u201d \\u201cBut how do you get paid?\\u201d \\u201cWe are private attorneys, but we contract with the county public defenders\\u2019 office. You and your husband couldn\\u2019t have attorneys from the same place. It\\u2019s a conflict.\\u201d I nod. I don\\u2019t know why I didn\\u2019t know this ten months ago, but it makes sense. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t relapse,\\u201d says Elizabeth. \\u201cDrug court only locks you up for the weekend. I have no idea what this judge will do. He could put you away for much longer as a probation violation. You don\\u2019t have the wiggle room of drug court.\\u201d I\\u2019m not worried about relapsing\\u2014I know my rock bottom has been bad enough. I won\\u2019t mess up. I take a deep breath. \\u201cDoes DJ know I am out?\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s not our problem,\\u201d says Elizabeth. \\u201cI know, but\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cHe shouldn\\u2019t be yours either.\\u201d Elizabeth says this softly, and Jonathan nods. \\u201cWell, does the jail know I\\u2019m here or am I in trouble with them already?\\u201d \\u201cYou can leave work release if you have court, or if Probation calls you in, or if you have to drug test. Just tell them in the lobby the day before or if you get called in to test, just let them know who\\u2019s requiring it that day so they can confirm. You can explain why you\\u2019re late today, and if they\\u2019re worried about it, they will confirm with Probation.\\u201d It seems complicated and inefficient, but I nod. \\u201cWe have to go. Call the office if you have any questions.\\u201d \\u201cThanks,\\u201d I say. I don\\u2019t add that I don\\u2019t have a cell phone because I am tired of my own voice bringing up problems. I am more fucked than I thought. On Thursday I go to Family Preservation Court as a requirement of probation. There, I learn that one requirement of Family Preservation Court is attending Sobriety Works\\u2014an outpatient three-night-a-week-for-three-hours program at the other end of the county. Every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday night for a year I will go to group treatment, be drug tested by yet another entity, attend outside twelve-step meetings, and meet with a private counselor. CPS also requires me to meet with a different private therapist. Probation doesn\\u2019t care about therapy, but they do require me to get a job and go to a different set of meetings. I have no idea how I\\u2019ll manage all my new responsibilities: going to three different courtrooms, pee testing for multiple agencies at different sites, seeing two therapists, going to twelve-step meetings, working at the jail, and supervised visits with Kaden. I write lists of each agency\\u2019s requirements, cross-reference them against each other, and tape them to the wall of my motel room like a murder board. Every Thursday morning I go to Family Preservation Court, where the judge and the CPS social workers and Sobriety Works treatment counselors will discuss how I did that week, check that I\\u2019ve been going to recovery meetings, and log it all into the system that will feed into CPS court and criminal court. On Friday mornings I go to criminal court and stand in front of Judge Marigonda, so he can read the report from the Family Preservation Court judge and tell me whether I have fucked up and am going back to jail. Both judges then send reports to the CPS court judge. So many judges, so little time. I\\u2019ve never been great at peeing on demand, so all this random drug testing requires me to hydrate excessively each day. It\\u2019s a pain, but on the plus side, my skin looks fabulous. It\\u2019s stressful not having a car and never knowing when you are going to be required to trek across the county to a drug test. It\\u2019s a full-time job meeting all the requirements\\u2014complicated by the fact that one of the requirements is getting a full-time job. The first time I have to take the bus across town for Sobriety Works, I give myself two hours to travel the eight or so miles. I haven\\u2019t been to Aptos since I was arrested, and I live in fear of running into one of my former neighbors. I know they would never take the bus, but still I\\u2019m afraid someone will recognize me. In my mind, everyone who looks at me for more than half a second knows that I am the neighbor from hell. There\\u2019s a fine line between shame and narcissism. At the bus stop, I try to make sense of the schedule, the bus numbers, and the routes, but it might as well be hieroglyphics. It\\u2019s raining, and I jump on the first bus heading south. After more than an hour, it pulls into a large mall halfway to Aptos. Everyone gets off but me. \\u201cLast stop,\\u201d says the bus driver. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m trying to get to Aptos. The seventy-one is supposed to go to Aptos.\\u201d I say this with more conviction than I feel, because I\\u2019m not even sure I\\u2019m on the 71. \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t the bus to Aptos.\\u201d \\u201cWhen is the next bus to Aptos?\\u201d \\u201cLook at the schedule, but probably not for another thirty minutes. Maybe more.\\u201d \\u201cCan\\u2019t you take me to Aptos?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not a taxi, this is a public bus.\\u201d He shakes his head. \\u201cBut I didn\\u2019t know I had to get off here\\u2026\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why I am telling him this. He has nothing to do with the obstacle course I have to run every day. \\u201cAll buses go to the same place,\\u201d he says. I don\\u2019t know what to say to this. For some reason, it strikes me as profound. Like a black-and-white photo, or anything said in a British accent. But it also drains me of hope. This moment breaks me. The darkness outside, the fact that I will be late to my first night at Sobriety Works, and all the horrible consequences I imagine has me ugly crying in the back of a bus. I don\\u2019t have a car, a job, a friend, a partner, an ally. I don\\u2019t have anyone to help me get where I need to go in this new life of mine. Even when I get Kaden back, I won\\u2019t have a home to fit the rest of my boys. All I\\u2019ve focused on is getting out and getting Kaden back. That is how I\\u2019ve triaged my life. But always in the back of my mind this painful truth has lurked. Never again can I wake them up in the morning for school, nag them to do their homework, curl up on a couch and watch a movie with them. I can\\u2019t pick them up from school, drive them to their basketball games, or sit in their room at night and talk about their day. I have lost my three older boys in those ways forever. And I miss them so much I can\\u2019t breathe. I miss being their mom. I hate myself for what I have done to them. Kaden may be young enough to forget, but my older boys never will. I am their torment, the source of their shame. I will be their college essay topic and the star of their therapy sessions for years to come. And now I am lost on a bus at an empty mall on a Monday night, grieving for the life I took for granted, grieving for my children, grieving for all the mundane moments that now feel like lost treasure. The driver interrupts my tearful reverie. \\u201cThis is the end of the line. You have to get off.\\u201d His face in the rearview mirror looks worried and maybe slightly afraid. He looks over his shoulder at me. \\u201cSeriously, you need to get off.\\u201d I wipe my eyes as I walk toward the front of the bus. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d he mumbles as I pass him. \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d I say, and I rush down the stairs into the rainy night. The only good thing about working outside the main jail all day is that it\\u2019s exhausting. I doze off early at the Hitching Post and sleep dreamlessly. I\\u2019m also happy that there are cameras outside the jail. I make sure to walk directly in front of them every two hours and go inside to ask the officer on duty a random question about the weed whacker or the pruning shears or whether there are more gloves handy. I need to make sure nobody can say I am somewhere I\\u2019m not. The fear of someone calling Probation again has turned me chatty. Every night before I go to sleep, I write down who I talked to and at what times and what I did all day. The days turn into weeks, and I discover that I love blowing autumn leaves with the leaf blower. It\\u2019s the only thing that makes me feel powerful. I have the leaf blower backpack on during my last day of work release when I feel a hand on my shoulder. I turn around and it\\u2019s DJ. His head is completely shaved. I drop the backpack and give him a big hug. \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d \\u201cThey let me out a few days early,\\u201d he says. \\u201cAre you\\u2026 okay?\\u201d I ask. I scrutinize him for signs of drug use, but he looks clear-eyed and healthy. \\u201cAll good,\\u201d he says. \\u201cHow did you get here?\\u201d He tilts his head toward the parking lot where his mom sits in her Mercedes. \\u201cWhat time are you done?\\u201d \\u201cFour p.m. It\\u2019s my last day.\\u201d \\u201cI know. I think that\\u2019s why they held me until now. I should have been out on work release too.\\u201d \\u201cI think they are trying to separate us. Did you know I got moved to Family Preservation Court instead of drug court?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, Maya told me. It\\u2019s some more bullshit.\\u201d \\u201cI think it\\u2019s good. It\\u2019s going to help us get Kaden back.\\u201d He wraps his arms around me tightly. \\u201cNobody is going to separate us again. They can do what they want. It\\u2019s me and you.\\u201d I murmur agreement and rest my head on his shoulder. It feels good to not be alone, but I close my eyes so I can pretend I feel more than that for the husband I have not seen in such a long time. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll be back to get you at four p.m. My mom is going to help us find a place.\\u201d \\u201cAre you serious?\\u201d \\u201cYep. I told you I\\u2019d take care of things.\\u201d I look over at Carol in the car and give her a big smile and a wave. Finding a place is the first step to getting Kaden back, and I\\u2019m so grateful she\\u2019s willing to help. My mind flashes on all the girls in G who won\\u2019t have help finding a place so they can get their babies back. There\\u2019s Section 8 housing, but the waitlist is three years long. I applied for it from G, but with a wait that long almost everyone\\u2019s CPS clocks would run out before they get bumped up the list. Then you have to find a landlord willing to take a voucher, and those landlords are rare. \\u201cWe only need a one-bedroom,\\u201d I say, \\u201cso Kaden can have his own room, and we can sleep on a futon in the living room. Maybe even a studio, and we could divide it. He needs his own room in some way.\\u201d My mind is racing. What does CPS require? What does Kaden need to feel like he\\u2019s home? I know that he needs me, but I am not enough for CPS. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to look for places while you finish up. Try to find something we can look at in person today. My mom\\u2019s booked us a hotel until we find a place.\\u201d \\u201cI have a few more days at the Hitching Post\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cThere is no way I\\u2019m staying at the Hitching Post. We\\u2019ll grab all your stuff from there too.\\u201d \\u201cOkay\\u2026\\u201d It feels disconcerting to have someone else making decisions for me suddenly. It\\u2019s another big change, and any change right now gives me vertigo. \\u201cAnd what the hell did you do to your hair?\\u201d asks DJ. I could ask him the same question, but instead I touch my head self-consciously. Last week, I bought a four-dollar box of brown hair dye and darkened my hair in my Hitching Post bathroom. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want people recognizing me,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI feel like I\\u2019m getting stared at a lot on the bus. I want to be anonymous.\\u201d \\u201cFuck those people,\\u201d says DJ. I\\u2019m afraid of those people. Maybe people don\\u2019t see the \\u201cneighbor from hell\\u201d when they stare at me, or maybe they do. All I see when I look in the mirror is that headline staring back at me. I don\\u2019t want to be who I am, and the brown hair helps. I look in the mirror and I don\\u2019t recognize the scared, anxious, brown-haired girl looking back at me. I was worried about how Kaden might react to my new hair color, but he hadn\\u2019t even noticed. When we\\u2019re together, we\\u2019re just looking in each other\\u2019s eyes and playing and talking and laughing. I could be bald and he wouldn\\u2019t care. I\\u2019m just his mom and he\\u2019s just my KK, my \\u201cCakes,\\u201d and we don\\u2019t care about anything but being together. Dylan, Cody, and Ty came to see me at the motel, and they were happy but cautious, especially Dylan. \\u201cTrust is something you have to earn, Mom,\\u201d he said, and he\\u2019s right. All I can do is show up each day and do the next right thing. I don\\u2019t care if DJ hates my hair. Plus, if someone calls Probation with a fake report, they\\u2019ll give the wrong description of me. My brown hair is my biggest safety net right now. Carol helps us rent a four-hundred-square-foot apartment, and we move in a week later. She lends us a car too. The rent is a thousand dollars a month. Our mortgage used to be more than five times that, but now I have no idea how we will pay. Carol will help us for a few months, but we both need jobs. I have no idea how to find a job that will hire a felon, much less allow me to leave on any given day for one to three hours depending on whether Probation, Family Preservation Court, or CPS demands a drug test. Since it\\u2019s all County-related, you would think one of the agencies could do the random drug testing and share the results with the others, but it doesn\\u2019t work that way. After two months of supervised visits and drug tests and drug court for DJ and Family Preservation Court for me, our social worker comes to inspect our apartment. It\\u2019s only one bedroom, but I deck that out with books and art supplies and a bunk bed with a slide that I know Kaden will love. Some of it is stuff from our old house, others are things I find at Goodwill and the dollar store and garage sales. You can pretty much see the whole apartment once you step in the door, but I show our CPS worker the entire place like I am giving a grand tour. It\\u2019s not much. It\\u2019s not fancy. But it has a bedroom for Kaden, I explain. It\\u2019s safe. It\\u2019s a home. I show her how the futon turns into a bed and say that\\u2019s where we will sleep while Kaden has the bedroom. I doubt he will sleep on his own, but I don\\u2019t tell her that. After the tour, she says she will allow unsupervised visits, then overnights. If all goes well, we can be reunified before his fifth birthday in December. This feels like the first victory I\\u2019ve had in a year. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a cute place,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI\\u2019ll see you in Family Preservation Court next week.\\u201d I thank her profusely. DJ is standing behind me during this exchange, and as soon as she leaves he goes into the bathroom. I can see Kaden living here. I can see reading him books as he falls asleep. Two more months and I\\u2019ll be able to breathe again. Sleep again. I open the bathroom door to tell my husband how excited I am, how for the first time I see a glimmer of a path forward, how I feel hope again. He startles when I burst in. It takes me a while to register what I\\u2019m seeing. A mirror, white lines of powder on the mirror, a rolled-up dollar bill. I have no words. \\u201cI failed my drug test,\\u201d he says. \\u201cDrug court is remanding me for the weekend.\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you mean they\\u2019re remanding you?\\u201d I ask. I know what remanding means; it means the bailiffs are going to take him back to jail and lock him up. What I don\\u2019t understand is how this could be happening. How he could say he\\u2019s taking care of us and then do this. \\u201cI tested dirty, so I have to go back to jail from tonight until Monday morning.\\u201d He says this slowly, as if I\\u2019m an idiot, and shrugs like it\\u2019s no big deal. \\u201cWhat did you test dirty for?\\u201d \\u201cHeroin.\\u201d I point at the white lines on the mirror. \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d He looks surprised at the question. \\u201cIt\\u2019s no big deal.\\u201d It\\u2019s a big fucking deal to me. I feel stupid for not knowing. For somehow thinking we were on the same page. That we were a team. That he had finally changed. If I stay with DJ, I will end up back in jail, and I will lose Kaden. I can\\u2019t go back, and I won\\u2019t lose him. \\u201cGet out,\\u201d I say quietly. \\u201cTake all your stuff. Take the car your mom gave us. Get out.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s no big deal,\\u201d he insists. \\u201cI\\u2019m snorting my antidepressants. I just did heroin once last week with my homeboy from jail. That\\u2019s why I tested dirty. This is just my antidepressant.\\u201d \\u201cYou have ten minutes to get all your stuff.\\u201d He swears and punches the bathroom door. \\u201cEight minutes.\\u201d He piles his things into the car. I know his mom won\\u2019t pay the rent now that I\\u2019ve kicked him out. I know that without a car it will be hard to get to all the courthouses and drug tests and therapy sessions, but I will find a way. He pulls a towel from the closet and stacks it on his suitcase. His face is red except for the dusting of white powder around his nostrils. \\u201cYou hypocrite. You\\u2019re just looking for a way out of this marriage. You\\u2019re making a huge mistake, you heartless bitch!\\u201d he shouts. I don\\u2019t have anything to say to that, but I\\u2019m not heartless. I\\u2019m Mama Love, so I open the linen closet, pull out a washcloth, and place it on top of his towel. He slams the front door as he leaves, and I rush to lock it. In jail it\\u2019s not okay to snitch, but I\\u2019m not in jail anymore. My hands shake as I dial our CPS worker, but my voice is strong as I tell her everything. \\n chapter 15 JOINT AND SEVERAL I get word that Kaden will be allowed to move in with me right before his fifth birthday. Darcy brings over all his clothing vacuum-sealed in clear plastic bags. Right now she controls access to my older boys, so I smile at her and pretend I have forgotten all the ways I believe she tried to thwart this reunification. \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure what I will do for his birthday, but you\\u2019re welcome to come,\\u201d I say. She smiles a big fake smile and looks around my minuscule apartment. \\u201cYou might want to do something at my house. Well, in the yard. I don\\u2019t want you in my house.\\u201d I fake smile back at her while Kaden grips my hand tightly. When she leaves he and I just look at each other. \\u201cDo you want to cuddle?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cRead a book?\\u201d He just holds his arms out to me. I pick him up and he clings to me and nestles his head in my neck. I carry him to the couch, and he stays wrapped around me as I sit. I kiss his head and face and soak in the warmth of him. We\\u2019ve had two overnight visits, but he knows today that he doesn\\u2019t have to go back. As long as I don\\u2019t do drugs, we can stay together forever. And then I remember all the probation requirements that can send me back to jail even if I do nothing wrong. A missed phone call. A missed test. A missed check-in at court. Anyone calling at any time to make something up about me. But today he is with me, and I try to remain in the power of now. I rock him and murmur sweet words into the top of his head. We sit like this until he falls asleep in my arms. The memory of him sobbing and CPS pulling him away from my handcuffed arms flickers across my mind like it always does when I have a quiet moment, but I will it away. I vow silently to do everything I can to make this last year up to him. My arms go numb holding him while he sleeps, but I will not disturb him by moving. When he wakes up, we walk the two feet into our miniature kitchen, where I get him grapes and make him a sandwich. We sit at the tiny Formica table I found at a garage sale \\u201cFree\\u201d pile, and I ask him what he wants to do for his birthday. He shrugs shyly. \\u201cHold on,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI got you something!\\u201d I run to his room and grab a balloon I bought at the dollar store. Kaden loves balloons, and he loves to play a game he calls pack attack, where you hit the balloon back and forth to keep it from touching the ground. \\u201cWe can play pack attack,\\u201d I say, handing him the balloon. He carefully cradles it in his hands. \\u201cThank you,\\u201d he says solemnly. He sets the balloon on the table, walks over to me, and wraps his arms around my waist. I hug him back, not knowing why he is so serious. \\u201cOf course,\\u201d I say brightly. He looks up at me, all blond hair and blue eyes and chubby cheeks. \\u201cThank you, Mommy. I love my birthday present.\\u201d I see what the last year has done to him. A single balloon is the most he can imagine from me. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just a balloon,\\u201d I assure him. \\u201cNot your birthday present.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d he says, but I hear the doubt in his voice. \\u201cI was thinking we could get some Star Wars Legos,\\u201d I say, \\u201cand then we can build a spaceship!\\u201d \\u201cReally?\\u201d \\u201cYes, really!\\u201d I give him big, loud smooches. He laughs at the smooches and then turns and grabs the balloon. \\u201cPack attack!\\u201d he yells. I dive to keep it from hitting the ground and yell \\u201cPack attack\\u201d as I send it soaring into the living room. He laughs and runs after it, and we spend the next hour chasing it around our tiny apartment. Later that night when he\\u2019s asleep, I swallow my pride and call Darcy. I ask her if I can set up a bouncy house in her yard for Kaden\\u2019s birthday. I then ask her if I can speak to my older boys, and they agree to help me set up a treasure hunt on the beach for Kaden as well. For Dylan\\u2019s fifth birthday I had a huge party with Big Bird from Sesame Street and pony rides for all the kids. For Cody\\u2019s fifth birthday we went to Disneyland. For Ty\\u2019s fifth birthday we had a giant pool party and costumed Barney the Purple Dinosaur. I stay awake almost all night, constantly checking on Kaden while he sleeps and wondering how I\\u2019m going to pay for a bouncy house and a birthday party and Legos. I know presents shouldn\\u2019t matter to me, but they do. Five is a big birthday and I missed his birthday last year. And Christmas. And everything for all my boys. I\\u2019ve been so focused on the acute crisis of not losing Kaden that I haven\\u2019t begun to tackle the chronic problem of creating a home for all my boys. I need a big house. I need space for them. I\\u2019m embarrassed at the idea they will be embarrassed by where I live right now. I spent so much of my childhood embarrassed by my family, and now I think my own boys must be embarrassed to have me as their mom. I\\u2019m certainly embarrassed to be me. A part of me simply wants to give up. Call it. Game over. I will never be the mom they deserve. And another part of me knows I\\u2019m just feeling raw and hypersensitive and sober and alone. I want to give up, but I won\\u2019t. One birthday party at a time. Every time I close my eyes over the next few weeks, I see Kaden\\u2019s face turned up to mine in gratitude for a dollar-store balloon. Within weeks his good behavior, his excessive politeness, ends. He is eating well, which is a relief, but now he offers up tantrums and random bursts of anger. I theorize that subconsciously he\\u2019s trying to push me away just to see if I go. He tests me every chance he gets, and through it all I try to remain steady and nonreactive. I tell the CPS-ordered therapist that his rage is a relief. \\u201cWhy?\\u201d she asks. \\u201cBecause the good behavior meant that he thought his bad behavior had caused our separation. That I left him on purpose because of something he did. I\\u2019d much rather he blame me than blame himself.\\u201d She nods but, like a therapist, doesn\\u2019t indicate whether I\\u2019m right or wrong. \\u201cHe thought I got him a dollar-store balloon for his birthday,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThat sounds like a fine birthday present.\\u201d \\u201cNo, it was the look on his face. He was so sad and serious and he was\\u2026 he was caretaking me in that moment. I grew up thinking I was responsible for everybody else in my family\\u2014that their well-being depended on me. I can\\u2019t have him think that, I just can\\u2019t!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t mean to say all that. She works for the court and I need to focus only on Kaden\\u2019s well-being. \\u201cTrauma is tricky,\\u201d she observes. \\u201cWell, what should I do?\\u201d She tilts her head in the way only basset hounds and therapists do. \\u201cWhat do you think you should do?\\u201d If I were president I would sign an executive order never allowing therapists or anyone to answer a question with a question. Especially not this question. If people knew what to do, would therapy even be a profession? She must see the look of disgust on my face because she basset-hounds her head to the other side, turns over a sheet of paper on her clipboard, and clears her throat. \\u201cYou might want to consider working to process your own trauma.\\u201d \\u201cWhat trauma?\\u201d \\u201cWell, to start there is the trauma of your arrest, being in jail, Kaden being in the system.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s not trauma,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI caused all that. All those things are my fault, not my trauma.\\u201d \\u201cTrauma is complex\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWill Kaden be okay?\\u201d I interrupt her. \\u201cLike I said, he\\u2019s a perfectly normal child. Five-year-olds have tantrums and meltdowns all the time. This is normal behavior. Don\\u2019t read into it too much.\\u201d She flips through his folder. \\u201cHe does well in preschool, he\\u2019s sweet, he\\u2019s communicative, he laughs a lot, he plays, he has friends, he\\u2019s eating, he\\u2019s sleeping, he\\u2019s a happy and well-adjusted little boy, and he obviously loves you.\\u201d It\\u2019s hard for me to believe it could be true. I desperately want it to be true. The therapist clears her throat and sets the folder down. \\u201cBut tell me, how are you sleeping? When is the last time you laughed and played with anyone besides Kaden? Do you have friends?\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you think?\\u201d I ask, tilting my head pointedly to the side. I am nervous for our next CPS court hearing. Kaden is living with me full time, and as hard as it has been to meet all my requirements alone, it\\u2019s even harder to do it with a five-year-old in tow. I was a single mom of three boys for almost ten years before I married DJ so I am no stranger to the challenges, but without a job, money, a car, or a friend it is like I am running an obstacle course designed by a sadist while carrying a five-year-old on my back. I can\\u2019t put him down. I don\\u2019t want to put him down. But we are clinging so tightly to each other that it\\u2019s hard for either of us to get enough air to run this marathon. A friend of my mom\\u2019s has an old car she doesn\\u2019t want. It barely runs, but it\\u2019s mine if I can get up to San Francisco and drive it back home. I have to go to traffic court to get my license reinstated because I couldn\\u2019t fix an expired registration fix-it ticket while I was in jail so my license was suspended. It\\u2019s another fine I must add to the growing list of court fees that amount to service charges for being on probation, for being monitored by the courts, for paperwork that\\u2019s been filed. I can\\u2019t opt out of these. These charges are yet another way the system makes it seemingly impossible to get past my past. But my next visit to CPS court makes me think I can put my past behind me. Judge Guy has long brown hair, big brown eyes, and a warm smile. Our massive files are stacked before her, and she peers out at us over the top of them. She quickly observes and interprets the fact that, for the first time in this courtroom, DJ and I are not sitting together. \\u201cBoth parents are responsible for meeting the reunification requirements individually,\\u201d she reminds us. \\u201cBut do we both have to?\\u201d I quickly whisper to my new CPS attorney whose name I don\\u2019t even know. \\u201cWhat if DJ doesn\\u2019t do anything? What if he relapses? What if he\\u2019s in jail?\\u201d Judge Guy seems to know what I am whispering because before my attorney can even respond she says, \\u201cI\\u2019d like to remind all parties that this court also has the power to determine custody matters, both legal and physical. That can be done here and not in family divorce court. That can be settled prior to divorce court proceedings.\\u201d I let this sink in. If I meet all the requirements, I can get permanent custody of Kaden regardless of what DJ does or doesn\\u2019t do. Judge Guy asks me how Kaden is doing now that he\\u2019s living with me. I report on his progress, and she tells me I\\u2019m doing a great job. She doesn\\u2019t address DJ. I latch on to her validation like a life raft. When the hearing is over, my attorney tells me that if I do all the work, DJ\\u2019s actions will have no effect on Kaden\\u2019s custody situation. \\u201cHe can do drugs, go to jail, whatever he wants. If you have sole custody, it will be up to you to protect Kaden, to show you will do that even if it means keeping him from his father. If you don\\u2019t, they can take him again.\\u201d It is one more weight I must carry. Kaden and his dad love each other, but I may have to keep them apart to keep Kaden. Somehow, DJ graduates drug court early. I\\u2019m still on probation with two months left at Sobriety Works, but he\\u2019s done with probation, with random drug tests, and the obligation to pay back our debts. The probation department has even given him a thousand dollars, presumably to help him get back on his feet. Never mind that his mother is bankrolling him. When he gloats about this bonus over the phone, I shoot back, \\u201cWhy would they do that? What about our restitution? You\\u2019re not supposed to get off probation until all restitution is paid.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t know why, it\\u2019s part of drug court. I didn\\u2019t ask questions; I took the money. But our restitution is now your restitution.\\u201d \\u201cThe restitution is joint and several,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWe\\u2019re responsible together and equally.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m off probation, which means I don\\u2019t have to pay anything. The \\u2018several\\u2019 means you. You are responsible now.\\u201d The unfairness of this has me shaking. I\\u2019m so angry, but my anger always comes out in tears and a wobbly voice. \\u201cYou aren\\u2019t going to help?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to make me pay it all back myself?\\u201d \\u201cMy mom paid part of it so we could get our plea, that was my share.\\u201d \\u201cShe paid that for both of us, for Kaden.\\u201d \\u201cNope.\\u201d Paying off thousands of dollars all by myself is impossible. I will be on probation forever. \\u201cCan you even look at yourself in the mirror right now?\\u201d I try to say this with righteous force, but it comes out weak and unsteady. Not the effect I was going for. \\u201cHalf that money is bullshit money for things we didn\\u2019t do. I\\u2019m not paying anything.\\u201d \\u201cSo I\\u2019m going to take care of Kaden, do everything for CPS, pay back the money, while you do\\u2026 what?\\u201d I walk out the back door of our apartment so Kaden can\\u2019t hear me. The minute I am outside, my voice matches the anger I feel. I am yelling. \\u201cShoot heroin with your ridiculous homeboys? You grew up in fucking Los Gatos! You\\u2019re going to dress like you\\u2019re a gangster now and go in and out of jail like it\\u2019s what, cool? What gang do you represent again\\u2026 the mortgage broker gang? The mommy-pays-your-rent crew?\\u201d I sound ridiculous even to myself, but it\\u2019s easier to get mad than to feel betrayed, abandoned, lost, alone. After I slam the phone down, I take Kaden for a walk. We walk away from the beach toward Santa Cruz. It\\u2019s only when we are a block away from the Gemma offices that I realize where I\\u2019ve been going. Gemma. Cassandra. Graduation. The last place I felt welcomed and celebrated. There\\u2019s a new executive director named Cynthia who I don\\u2019t know very well but who invites me into her office. She offers Kaden some toys, and he plays in a sitting area next to her office while I vent and spew to her about all my struggles. \\u201cBut you\\u2019re doing it,\\u201d she points out. \\u201cYou are showing up every day and doing it.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m so tired,\\u201d I moan, and tears start to come. I quickly wipe them away. \\u201cOf course you\\u2019re tired.\\u201d She looks through the open door at Kaden and then back at me. \\u201cBut you\\u2019re winning. You\\u2019ve already won. Look how much you\\u2019ve done in such a short time.\\u201d I nod and try to muster some sense of accomplishment, of pride, but I\\u2019m still wading in the unfairness of DJ\\u2019s situation versus mine. \\u201cI\\u2019m pretty sure you haven\\u2019t made it this far by feeling sorry for yourself.\\u201d I laugh at this tough-love comment. Cynthia has multicolored hair and is short and small and beautiful. She also seems like a straightshooter, which I appreciate. \\u201cDefinitely not,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWell then, it\\u2019s probably not time to start. Besides, there\\u2019s a lot of women who have it a lot worse.\\u201d She glances over at Kaden, who stands in the open doorway, and gives him a big smile. \\u201cI have cookies,\\u201d she says. \\u201cLet\\u2019s have some cookies.\\u201d So we have a picnic on her floor, and Kaden tells her about his bunk bed and how he wants to make curtains around them. \\u201cI\\u2019m excellent at making curtains,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t we go to the fabric store?\\u201d Kaden jumps up and down with excitement and looks at me to ask if it\\u2019s okay. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go to the fabric store, then,\\u201d I shout. Cookies, curtains, and a new friend. Such simple gifts really, but they\\u2019re just what I needed to get through another day. I graduate Sobriety Works and Family Preservation Court, and a few months later Judge Guy gives me permanent custody of Kaden. As amazing as it feels, it also feels anticlimactic. Every waking moment was devoted to getting him back\\u2014it was all survival and struggle and fight. And now the war is suddenly over, and I don\\u2019t know how to settle into a normal life. I don\\u2019t even know what a normal life is supposed to look like. Maybe I never did. When I ask my new probation officer about getting off probation and getting my record expunged, he tells me that\\u2019s only for people in drug court, not Family Preservation Court. \\u201cBut I was moved out of drug court as a reward. I was promised the same benefits in Family Preservation Court.\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing in the case notes about that. There\\u2019s no order from the judge about that.\\u201d \\u201cBut my codefendant\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cHe was in drug court.\\u201d Yet again, I\\u2019m facing brutal and inexplicable inequity, and yet again, I can do nothing about it. I will be on probation for the next five years. At any time, I can be called in to drug test. Any member of law enforcement can search my home and person and car and computer at any time. I can\\u2019t leave the county without permission. I have to pay off court fees and fines, which have compounding interest monthly, and I have to pay all remaining restitution. Normal is still a long way off. And I was a fool to think the war had really ended. \\n chapter 16 FUCKING GOOGLE In the real world, one graduate degree does not trump one felony, much less thirty-two. Because one of my felonies is for drug possession, I can\\u2019t get any cash welfare benefits. The welfare system automatically assumes anyone with a prior drug conviction will spend their money on dope rather than rent, utilities, gas, and food. It doesn\\u2019t matter that all my drug tests are clean, or that I\\u2019m a graduate of Sobriety Works. The conviction is on my record and that\\u2019s the only context that matters. If I had gone to drug court this wouldn\\u2019t be an issue\\u2014my record would have been expunged. The only way around this is to go back to court, appeal this particular conviction, and get it reduced to a misdemeanor. Another giant hurdle that my short legs can\\u2019t clear. Plus, I don\\u2019t have childcare and the idea of bringing Kaden to criminal court is untenable. I couldn\\u2019t leave him sitting in the back of the courtroom while I stand in front of the judge. And what if something went wrong and they tried to take me back to jail? I can catastrophize at an Olympic level, and I imagine him sitting alone in the back of the courtroom while I am dragged away in handcuffs. Every job I apply for asks me to check a box if I have a criminal record and then explain the charges. There\\u2019s not enough space on the application to list all my convictions. And, like welfare, there\\u2019s no room for context in these applications, and certainly no place to explain that as long as I\\u2019m not on drugs I am a valuable and productive member of society worthy of employment. Online I check the box even though I know it means I\\u2019ll be automatically screened out. I could choose not to check the box, but, unfortunately, my recovery program is built on a foundation of rigorous honesty. Rigorous honesty seems great in principle, but it doesn\\u2019t translate well to a job search. Or the dating scene, where I\\u2019m not having much luck either. It\\u2019s hard enough for any soon-to-be-twice-divorced mom of four to hook up, but add the Sentinel headline and my criminal history, and my dating profile should just show a picture of a red flag. I\\u2019m lonely but resigned to the fact my future will not contain romance. I also know that picking great life partners is not part of my skill set. Sometimes, I sit on the back porch after Kaden is asleep and imagine someone loving me again. But the idea is as distant and unreachable as the stars I stare at. I feed my melancholy by listening to sad Irish love ballads by David Gray and sad American love ballads by John Mayer. A part of me just loves to wallow. Kaden starts kindergarten, and I am on high alert at back-to-school night and parent-teacher meetings, searching for signs that anyone recognizes me or knows about my past. He makes friends easily, but when other parents want to organize playdates I am at a loss. I\\u2019m embarrassed by my tiny apartment, and I don\\u2019t want to face the prospect of taking Kaden to their homes and making the small talk that would either reveal my felonious, addictive past or break my code of rigorous honesty. I enroll Kaden in a subsidized after-school program for working parents so he gets to socialize, and I get to be just one of many harried parents trying to afford childcare who have no time or energy to make new friends or linger over coffee. We wave to each other at pickup, but it\\u2019s from a safe distance. Cynthia from Gemma calls and says she has a temporary job for me, and I lunge at the opportunity. She wants me to case-manage other formerly incarcerated women with minor children and help them find jobs in the community under a state grant for the Community Action Board. CAB is the nonprofit agency that the Gemma Program runs under. It\\u2019s barely enough money to pay the rent, but it pays the rent. My job is to convince employers to hire the formerly incarcerated, match women with the employers, and then case-manage the women so they don\\u2019t fuck it up. Basically I have to Mama Love them into compliance\\u2014make sure they go to meetings, get out of toxic relationships that might interfere with their employment, help them find the right clothes, and coach them on how to act in different professional settings. I listen to their problems and work with them to find solutions. I do the same with employers. In theory, it seems like a no-brainer for business owners because half the employee\\u2019s pay comes from the grant money, but most of my job with the employers is convincing them that a formerly incarcerated woman makes the best employee. And it\\u2019s easy, because they do. Someone who\\u2019s been behind bars already knows that crime doesn\\u2019t pay. They\\u2019ve lost everything and appreciate the simple joy of having a job. They\\u2019ve dealt with prison politics, so office politics present no challenge. They understand power structures. Each is on probation or parole, so they follow all the rules. They\\u2019re used to getting up early and working hard for no pay, so they appreciate minimum wage. But most important, every one of them has something to prove. That they are valuable, worthy, and so much more than a criminal record. I know this about them because I am them. I met extremely smart women in jail\\u2014CEO-level smart. Former drug dealers who were sales and marketing geniuses, others who were hustlers and designers and innovators. I\\u2019d like to see Elon Musk design Ikea-level modular furniture out of Tampax boxes and toothpaste. I challenge any beauty influencer to create a full glam makeover out of hot water and a box of colored pencils. Or any Michelin-starred chef to make a delicious meal out of Cheetos, ramen, leftover hard-boiled eggs, hot water, and mystery meat. I\\u2019m not great at advocating for myself, but I\\u2019m really good at advocating for others, and I make some great matches in the business community. I help the women I manage form a co-op with other women in the program to help with childcare. I reach out to other nonprofits to help with r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9s, business clothing, and transportation vouchers. Arden loves books, so I find her a job at a local bookstore. Hannah tells me about her childhood love of horses\\u2014the thing that gave her meaning before meth took over\\u2014and I find work for her at an equine therapy program. After her wage subsidy runs out, they keep her on and promote her. The women work harder than is asked, always taking pride in their jobs and exceeding expectations. By all measures, the grant is a success, but, for reasons I cannot guess, the state doesn\\u2019t renew it. During my work for CAB, I see that my struggles are hardly mine alone. The barriers to becoming productive members of society are huge for just about anybody who\\u2019s been incarcerated. As a condition of probation or parole you have to have a job; to get a job you have to check that box that says you have a criminal record, which excludes you from getting a job. In order to show up to work every day you need somewhere to live; to find somewhere to live, you must have a job. The system is cobbled together out of catch-22s. I learn that if you\\u2019ve been incarcerated, you\\u2019re ten times more likely to be homeless, and if you\\u2019re homeless, you\\u2019re eleven times more likely to become incarcerated. It\\u2019s a crazy loop-the-loop that\\u2019s somehow overlooked in all the conversations about how to reduce recidivism. The system is illogical in its design, broken in its execution, and guaranteed to fail those it allegedly serves. When the grant ends, my job ends. I\\u2019m back where I started, which is nowhere. Until Cynthia comes to my rescue again. She calls me shortly after the grant runs out and tells me Cassandra is leaving her position as program director of Gemma. \\u201cI want you to apply for the job,\\u201d she says. \\u201cAre you crazy?\\u201d \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re perfect for it. You know the program, you know the needs of the women in jail, you\\u2019ve been advocating for incarcerated women, and you have experience developing curriculum from teaching in graduate school.\\u201d When she puts it that way, I consider it. \\u201cWhat do I need to do?\\u201d \\u201cFirst, you formally apply. And then there will be a series of interviews with me, with CAB, with the sheriff\\u2019s office and the probation department. All of them contribute to funding the Gemma Program. I love working with you, you\\u2019re amazing, and this is perfect.\\u201d The pay is twenty-two dollars an hour, which feels like a fortune. I know I will have to find childcare two mornings a week so Kaden can be brought to school while I pick up the women from Blaine Street in the Gemma van and take them to the church. It\\u2019s an obstacle, but I\\u2019ll figure that out after I get the job. My r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 is impressive if you ignore the felonies, and I\\u2019ve finally found a job that ignores them. I make it through three rounds of interviews. My final interview is with the deputy whose office I used to clean\\u2014whose mother I used to talk to. She\\u2019s in charge of the jail now, and she is a tough interrogator, but I can tell by the smile and hug she gives me at the end that I nailed it. Before Cynthia calls to officially offer me the job, I\\u2019ve already made lists of potential volunteers and classes that will help the women deal with life after incarceration. I know these women and what they need, because I know what I didn\\u2019t know and what I needed. I imagine this being my new career\\u2014advocate, changemaker, champion of the underdogs. I think back to the sunny winter day when I sat in Elizabeth\\u2019s office newly out on bail and heard about the plea deal. Then I still believed, like the twelve million other people who were arrested that year and the two million who were behind bars, that paying for your crimes meant doing your time and following Probation\\u2019s orders, and then your debt was paid. I had no idea how wrong I was, and I wanted to do my part to change that. I\\u2019ve told everyone about my new job\\u2014my mom, the boys, my probation officer. Cynthia calls me on a Monday to tell me my business cards have arrived, and I can start in a week. On Friday morning, I\\u2019m just about to go to a twelve-step meeting when Cynthia calls again. \\u201cHello, boss lady,\\u201d I answer. \\u201cHi,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWhere are you?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m just about to go into a meeting.\\u201d \\u201cI have bad news,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry.\\u201d My stomach flips. \\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d I sit down under a tree. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t have the job.\\u201d \\u201cWhat? Why?\\u201d \\u201cIt came from Probation. They said there is no way someone on probation is going to be allowed to take women out of Blaine and supervise them.\\u201d \\u201cBut Probation was part of the interview process,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t make sense. Probation was aware of this every step of the way.\\u201d Cynthia is quiet for a while. \\u201cIt\\u2019s coming from higher up. There\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d Tom, my old boyfriend, is still the district attorney. His wife is still high up in Probation. I ask if it was her. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who it was. All I know is we can\\u2019t hire you for the job.\\u201d \\u201cYou can,\\u201d I beg. \\u201cYou\\u2019re the head of the program. How can they tell you who to hire?\\u201d \\u201cThey can\\u2019t,\\u201d Cynthia says. \\u201cBut they said Probation would pull their funding if we hired you. Without that money, there\\u2019s no Gemma Program.\\u201d \\u201cI understand,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI feel so bad,\\u201d says Cynthia. \\u201cI\\u2019m so, so sorry. And I\\u2019m furious, it\\u2019s so unfair, it\\u2019s\\u2026\\u201d I know this isn\\u2019t her fault, but I can\\u2019t hear any more about the unfairness of the system I\\u2019m in from people who aren\\u2019t. \\u201cI have to get to my meeting,\\u201d I say, interrupting her. \\u201cI have to go.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, but\\u2026\\u201d I hang up and walk back to my car. I don\\u2019t have the energy to go to a meeting and hear some old guy in recovery say that \\u201csome days you are the bug, and some days you are the windshield,\\u201d or hear platitudes like \\u201cyour worst day sober is still better than your best day using.\\u201d It\\u2019s just not true. Because sometimes your worst day sober is your worst day ever and getting high seems like a really great day. But what do I know\\u2026 today I am just a bug. I find an online job at a company called Content Divas where I write blog posts on different topics. There was no background check, just a writing assignment. I have to produce 1,600 words a day. First, it\\u2019s ten different posts about savings accounts, then travel in Hawaii. The pay is only enough for gas and rice, but it\\u2019s something while I look for a full-time gig. The writing is fun, and I like having a deadline each day and the creative challenge of finding yet another metaphor to highlight the benefits of an online savings account. I imagine walking trails on Diamond Head in Waikiki and write as if I am there, smelling the plumeria and gardenia and being transformed in such a profound way that readers are driven to book their tickets through Content Divas\\u2019 client. I\\u2019m all too aware of the irony that both a savings account and travel to Hawaii are far out of reach for me. The reality is that I am out of a job, out of money, and out of options. The car I got from my mom\\u2019s friend now leaks oil faster than I can afford to replace it, and it can\\u2019t accelerate uphill. Today I have an appointment at the county welfare office to appeal the rejection of my application for cash benefits because of my criminal record. I\\u2019ve avoided Craigslist when looking for a job because I don\\u2019t want to get scammed or murdered, but I realize it\\u2019s the only chance of reaching employers without being disqualified by the criminal background question. I decide that if I\\u2019m asked, I will reveal my background, but if not I won\\u2019t volunteer the information. It\\u2019s a don\\u2019t ask, don\\u2019t tell policy that I feel still jibes with my rigorous honesty policy. I find an ad that\\u2019s ten days old, which is a lifetime in Craigslist years, but I call anyway. The woman who answers tells me they are about to make a decision, so I should send an email immediately. It\\u2019s an extensive ad for a part-time job as an assistant at a literary agency, but it seems like a fun writing exercise and a way to practice answering honestly without ratting myself out. I think about how great it would be to work with books\\u2014my first addiction. Along with my r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9, I\\u2019m supposed to write a paragraph about how I exemplify each required quality: organized, integrity, problem-solving, communicator, investigative, computer savvy, flexible, good with money, committed, and educated. I quickly google the company and Doug Abrams to make sure he\\u2019s not a serial killer, while at the same time doubting that someone who works with Archbishop Desmond Tutu is actually advertising on Craigslist. I say a quick prayer and pull up a blank screen to write a letter to go with my r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9. I write about how good I am under pressure, at meeting deadlines, at multitasking. How there is no task too small or too unimportant for me to do, and that I\\u2019m willing to work hard. I share my education and my writing experience. The integrity topic stumps me for a while, but I define integrity as keeping my word and showing up to do what I\\u2019ve committed to doing. I don\\u2019t want to lie about my criminal background, but nowhere in the application does it ask me about my past. I read it over and am happy with my responses. I allude to mistakes I\\u2019ve made without saying what they are. Don\\u2019t ask. Don\\u2019t tell. That has to be good enough for now, so I send the email. Hours later, when I read it all over, I realize that I\\u2019ve misspelled my own email address on my r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9. So much for that job. Five days later I have an appointment to apply for food stamps. Kaden is with me, and I spend hours trying to entertain him in a dismal lobby crammed with hard plastic chairs and miserable people. We build Legos together while I rehearse in my head exactly how I will plead my case. How can they look at his cute face and then tell me that he doesn\\u2019t deserve food because his mom once had a drug conviction? Punish me but don\\u2019t punish my son. My phone rings. I startle and drop the Legos. I quickly silence it and look around the waiting room apologetically. I may be a criminal, but I\\u2019m not rude, so I answer with a whisper. \\u201cHello?\\u201d The woman on the other end tells me she is Michelle, Doug Abrams\\u2019s assistant, and he would like to meet with me for the job at Idea Architects, the literary agency. Can I be there in an hour? If I walk out of here now, I\\u2019m not sure when or if I will get another appointment to appeal my case. And even if I could interview in an hour, I would need to find childcare, change my clothes, print out my r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9, and get gas. If the office is up a hill, I\\u2019m not even sure my car could make it. I can\\u2019t go. I hold the phone and watch Kaden walk over to the window and stare out. He needs a mom who is brave, who will feed him and protect him and love him. I don\\u2019t feel brave, but\\u2026 \\u201cHello?\\u201d says the woman on the phone. \\u201cAre you still there?\\u201d \\u201cThank you,\\u201d I say, with a loud exhale as I hurriedly pack up Kaden\\u2019s toys. \\u201cI will be there in an hour, of course. I\\u2019m looking forward to meeting you and Mr. Abrams.\\u201d Idea Architects is a room attached to Doug Abrams\\u2019s house. And it\\u2019s up a steep hill. But I get there on time. During the interview we discuss my r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9\\u2014my experience teaching English composition and creative writing at UC Irvine, the small literary press I worked for while I was in college\\u2014and nothing more. On my r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 I only listed \\u201crelevant work history\\u201d so Doug doesn\\u2019t ask me about anything I don\\u2019t want to share. I don\\u2019t list the pet cemetery business so I don\\u2019t have to talk about losing it because of our drug use and jail. At the end of the interview he also doesn\\u2019t ask, \\u201cBy any chance, do you have an extensive criminal background?\\u201d and I don\\u2019t volunteer the information. What he does say is, \\u201cI\\u2019d like to try you out on some tasks first, that way we can both see if we\\u2019re a good fit.\\u201d \\u201cI love tasks,\\u201d I say eagerly. \\u201cAnd I\\u2019d like to have you edit something for me, and read a manuscript and tell me what you think. I\\u2019ll pay you of course for these assignments.\\u201d I agree to all of it and spend the next two weeks researching minivans and HEPA filters for him as part of my task list, and when he asks me to edit a biography of Desmond Tutu on a Saturday, I quickly learn how to use track changes in Word and return twelve chapters to him by Sunday. I read another manuscript he sent me\\u2014a memoir of a doctor who was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and had some crazy woo-woo experiences but was living in gratitude and joy even in the face of death. I love this guy. I love his story. He makes me want to be someone who lives in gratitude and joy. The manuscript is a mess, though. Kaden and I are driving home from a twelve-step meeting when my phone rings. It\\u2019s Doug. \\u201cWhat did you think of the manuscript?\\u201d he asks. It\\u2019s after 9 p.m. \\u201cI liked it, but it was pretty hard to follow the story,\\u201d I say, not wanting to offend him. \\u201cIt jumps around too much to track. As a reader I was lost.\\u201d \\u201cHow would you fix it?\\u201d I pull over so I can take my phone off speaker. Kaden is falling asleep in his car seat, and Doug is a loud talker. \\u201cWell,\\u201d I stall. I do have an idea, but I don\\u2019t want to sound ridiculous. I am one hundred percent sure I have a solution to the structural problem, but I have trouble saying it out loud. Sometimes, one hundred percent isn\\u2019t enough. I\\u2019m not an editor. It\\u2019s been a decade or more since I\\u2019ve been a writer. I look at Kaden in the rearview mirror, and I think one hundred percent will have to do. I take a deep breath. \\u201cI would frame the whole book within the day of his diagnosis,\\u201d I say. \\u201cBut before he tells his family, and then the next chapter goes back to when he met his wife.\\u201d I lay out the rest of the chronology quickly. \\u201cHold on,\\u201d says Doug. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to patch you in with the author so you can tell him your ideas.\\u201d \\u201cWait, what?\\u201d I ask, but Doug has already put me on hold. I haven\\u2019t talked to any authors since my MFA days, and they were my professors. I\\u2019ve certainly never talked to an author with an agent before, and my heart starts hammering. I jump out of the car and stand in front of it so I can see Kaden through the window. I need to sound serious and professional for my surprise conference call. My previous conference call was an illegal three-way hookup in jail where I had a girl patch in Dylan\\u2019s cell phone so I could wish him a happy eighteenth birthday. Impostor syndrome kicks into overdrive as I stammer out my approach to the author, but he loves it. He says it\\u2019s brilliant. Doug tells him I will be working closely with him on the chapters and the proposal, and collaboratively writing it with him. I don\\u2019t know what collaborative writing means. After we all hang up, Doug calls me right back. \\u201cThat was great,\\u201d he says. \\u201cSo does this mean I have the job?\\u201d \\u201cYou have the job. Congratulations!\\u201d I thank him and do a little dance in front of the car, and Kaden starts laughing from his car seat. I get back in the driver\\u2019s seat and buckle up. \\u201cWe did it, baby guy! We got the job!\\u201d He smiles at me, half-asleep. That night as I carry him asleep into our little apartment, it feels like a home. I tuck him into bed in his clothes and kiss his forehead gently. I sit out on the back porch and look up at the stars and thank the universe. The job is only part-time, but it\\u2019s a real job. I can work while Kaden is in school. I can help create books that matter, and I feel like I might matter again. For the first time in a very long time peace settles upon me. On my first day at the office, Michelle, who has worked with Doug for five years, greets me. She tells me the Wi-Fi, hands me the keys to Doug\\u2019s house and a green pouch with a type of address book in it, and says here are all the passwords to everything and all the bank account and credit card numbers for the business and Doug\\u2019s personal accounts. And then she leaves. For a minute I think I must be getting punked, and I stare after her as she drives away. I look around anxiously as if Probation is going to pop out at me. I am alone in Doug\\u2019s house with all his credit card numbers. No algorithm needed. I shake my head at such naive trust at the same time as I vow never to break it. Apart from the editing and writing, I\\u2019m going to be paying all the bills for the business and for Doug personally, scheduling meetings, coordinating with the bookkeeper, and doing the day-to-day business of running the agency. I don\\u2019t know exactly what this entails because my predecessor only gave me a thirty-minute orientation before she peaced out for good. I open my computer and set up a company email address for myself. Michelle had told me that Doug wanted to send out a newsletter with the MyEmma program so that\\u2019s what I should work on first. I have no idea what MyEmma is, but I find it online and then I look for the password in the address book and log in as Doug. I quickly learn the program and create a newsletter campaign. The hours in the Craigslist ad said five to twenty a week, but because I want to do more than is expected I bring work home with me every night and don\\u2019t tell Doug I\\u2019m working unpaid hours after Kaden goes to sleep. We quickly settle into a rhythm in the office and the five to twenty hours becomes twenty-five paid hours right away. At twenty dollars an hour this feels like a fortune. I work on the doctor\\u2019s book proposal\\u2014a document that\\u2019s an abbreviated overview of the book that Doug will use to sell the book before it\\u2019s written\\u2014on the weekends on my own. I don\\u2019t have a desk, so I sit in a big comfy chair across from Doug and work with my computer on my lap. I listen to Doug\\u2019s calls with authors, with editors, with friends. He\\u2019s smart and generous and curious about everything. He\\u2019s enthusiastic and brilliant and full of book ideas. He has three children and a doctor wife, and they are all kind and loving. I sit in my chair watching out the window as his beautiful family passes by in the ebb and flow of their lives, and it makes me both happy and sad. Doug\\u2019s son is the same age as Ty, and I love the sound of him and his friends coming and going. I love their laughter, their thumping, their mess, and their energy. Doug and I bounce ideas off each other easily, and he asks my opinion about everything\\u2014covers, potential authors, book topic ideas, edits we are each making. It\\u2019s like we have been working together for years. We are still in the awkward getting-to-know-you stage, and while at first I was a little suspicious of his kindness, I quickly see that he is just a really good guy. When he tells me I am brilliant, I drive home that afternoon in my leaky, sputtering car feeling brilliant. He doesn\\u2019t know that on the day he says this it is my two-year sobriety birthday, but it still feels auspicious. My mind is clear. My energy for the job isn\\u2019t chemically induced. Five days later I\\u2019m still relishing my natural high and working away in my chair while Doug is on the phone with an author. I suddenly feel the air change, like when a hurricane or a tornado is about to hit, and the world goes silent, and the atmosphere gets thick and muggy and electric. I take a quick breath and slowly look up from my computer and meet Doug\\u2019s eyes. In them, I see shock and horror. He ends his call suddenly, his face pale. He stammers as he says, \\u201cGary was just telling me that employers now google all their employees, so I googled you.\\u201d For a second I can\\u2019t breathe. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t check your references,\\u201d he says slowly. I don\\u2019t know what to say or do. I want to run. I want to cry. I want to defend myself, but I can\\u2019t. \\u201cIt says you were convicted of identity theft. That you are the neighbor from\\u2026\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t finish the headline because even in his shock, he is kind. My face feels hot, and the room spins. \\u201cI have two years clean,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI made mistakes\\u2026 I hurt people\\u2026 but that\\u2019s not who I am when I\\u2019m clean.\\u201d I want to tell him that because he trusted me so instantly and blindly, I would never betray that trust. I want to tell him that I\\u2019m trying to get my children and my self-esteem back, and this work is my opportunity to do that, and I would never do anything to jeopardize it. I want to tell him that I don\\u2019t even drive a mile over the speed limit because I will never break another law as long as I live. I will never do anything that will hurt my children again. I want to say all of this, but my throat is dry, and I don\\u2019t want to start crying. \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you leave now,\\u201d Doug says. \\u201cI need to think about this and call your references and talk to my family.\\u201d I walk across the room and pick up the zippered bank pouch. I hand it to him along with the keys to the office. \\u201cCome back tomorrow at eleven, and we\\u2019ll talk,\\u201d he adds. \\u201cOkay,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, Doug. I\\u2019m really sorry.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\\u201d I am embarrassed and mortified and ashamed and lost. Fucking Google. I call Cynthia as soon as I get home and tell her what\\u2019s happened. \\u201cHe\\u2019s already called me,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI told him that you managed a million-dollar grant and had access to all our information, and I would trust you without reservation.\\u201d \\u201cThank you,\\u201d I say. \\u201cHow did he seem?\\u201d \\u201cKind of stressed, to be honest, and a little mad at himself for not checking references before he hired you.\\u201d \\u201cWould you have told him I went to jail?\\u201d \\u201cNot unless he asked,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI can\\u2019t go back there,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI can\\u2019t drive back to that house and face him and lose my dream job all over again.\\u201d \\u201cYou can, and you will,\\u201d says Cynthia. \\u201cYou have so much to offer, remember that. I think he\\u2019s a good guy. I think he\\u2019s going to do the right thing.\\u201d At about 4 a.m. I get up and sit on the porch until the sky gets light. The idea of seeing Doug again fills me with dread, but the idea of hiding from him gives me a worse feeling\\u2014regret. If he fires me, then he fires me. For a brief shining moment I was brilliant, and I can be brilliant again. He is at his desk when I walk in and sit in my chair. Before he can say anything, I take a deep breath and start talking. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry I put you in this position, Doug,\\u201d I say, \\u201cI really am, but I want to say that I\\u2019m just as brilliant today as you thought I was before you read that article. And it\\u2019s important to me that you know I didn\\u2019t lie to you. If you had asked me, I would have told you. But let\\u2019s face it, if I had told you before you asked, I would never have gotten this job. But I am sorry you had to find out the way you did.\\u201d My voice quivers, but I speak firmly. \\u201cI appreciate you saying that.\\u201d Doug\\u2019s voice is somber. \\u201cI did call all your references. I talked to my family. And I spent all morning really thinking about what it means to walk your talk.\\u201d I nod. \\u201cLook, I can\\u2019t work with Archbishop Tutu and not put into practice his ideas around forgiveness, redemption, and Ubuntu. So what I want to say is I believe in you.\\u201d \\u201cYou do?\\u201d \\u201cYes, and I want you to work here. Work with me. Idea Architects needs you.\\u201d Tears flow freely down my face. Doug hands me a tissue. \\u201cBut maybe we hire someone else to handle the finances, and you handle the writing and editing?\\u201d \\u201cFair enough,\\u201d I say. It stings a little, but I understand. We hire a woman to handle the bills, but I end up overseeing it all anyway. Eventually Doug hands me back the green pouch, the woman leaves, and we don\\u2019t talk any more about it. Five months into my job at Idea Architects, we find fraud on one of the credit card accounts\\u2014a $700 purchase for a gift basket that nobody ordered. We close the account, and the bank reverses the charge, and Doug seems not to be overly bothered by it since no money is lost. I can\\u2019t let the incident go, though. I google the name of the business on the credit card statement and call the number. I talk a store worker into telling me where they shipped the wine basket after he says he cannot legally give me the name. I Google-search all over Ohio until I find all the names that match that address. Unfortunately, it\\u2019s an apartment building so there are lots of names connected to the address. I call the store worker back and try again to get the name on the order. He still won\\u2019t give it to me. \\u201cHow about I just say some names to you, and you tell me if any of them sound familiar to you. That\\u2019s not telling me anything. Please,\\u201d I say, \\u201cmy job depends on it.\\u201d It\\u2019s not quite true, but it feels true to me. I start reading down a list of names and he clears his throat after one man\\u2019s name. \\u201cDoes that name sound familiar to you?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cIt definitely sounds like a name I have seen before,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI would tell you I love you, but that would be weird, so thank you!\\u201d I reverse address search until I find the phone number, a landline that matches the name and address. Easy-peasy. I haven\\u2019t thought this all the way through, and as the phone rings in Ohio I realize I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m going to say. A man answers after about five rings. \\u201cHi,\\u201d I say. \\u201cDid you order a gift basket in April?\\u201d The man hangs up. I call back and I\\u2019m surprised when he answers again. \\u201cLook,\\u201d I say, \\u201cdon\\u2019t hang up. I\\u2019m not the police.\\u201d \\u201cWhat, then?\\u201d \\u201cI just need to know how you got the credit card number you used for the gift basket.\\u201d He\\u2019s silent for a long time and then, for some crazy reason, decides to answer me. \\u201cA guy I don\\u2019t know gave it to me, said it might be a working number.\\u201d \\u201cDid this guy live in California?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t know him.\\u201d I know he\\u2019s lying. I also know that sometimes people who work in restaurants will take a quick photo of your credit card when they\\u2019re processing your bill and then send the number to friends in another state. This makes the crime untraceable to the restaurant worker, and because people usually eat in the same zip code they live in, the fraudster has everything they need to use or sell a working credit card. \\u201cLook,\\u201d I say, \\u201cthe police are onto the scam. And because it\\u2019s across state lines the FBI are involved too.\\u201d I\\u2019m just making stuff up now, and I have no idea what scam I\\u2019m even talking about. \\u201cYou will not get another credit card number from any guys you know or don\\u2019t know, okay? You aren\\u2019t going to jail this time, but you could next time. And trust me, you don\\u2019t want to go to jail.\\u201d He hangs up. The next day I tell Doug I tracked down the name and number of the person who used his credit card for the wine basket. \\u201cWe should tell the credit card company,\\u201d he says. I call the company, but they just tell me to call the police. I don\\u2019t call the police, though. I hope I scared the guy straight with my crazy phone call. I don\\u2019t want to be blamed for the fraud, but I also don\\u2019t want this guy arrested. He\\u2019ll end up paying for that gift basket for who knows how many years, and I don\\u2019t wish that on anyone. I tackled this gift-basket case like I was the love child of the CIA and the NSA, and I go to sleep feeling better. Not because I cracked the case, but because I am now using my powers for good. \\n chapter 17 THE FOUR-MINUTE MILE Work becomes my new addiction. I have taken over the finances and the personal assisting, and, after we rewrite the book proposal and sample chapters, the doctor\\u2019s memoir sells for far more than anyone had imagined. I become the agency\\u2019s official in-house collaborative writer. When Doug tells me about another writing project he has for me, I reply, \\u201cYou are crazy.\\u201d \\u201cNo,\\u201d he says, \\u201cI\\u2019m not. You are the perfect person to help write this book.\\u201d He\\u2019s talking about The Book of Forgiving by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. I don\\u2019t know the first thing about forgiveness. I know about forgetting, but nobody is publishing The Book of Forgetting. I am on probation. I am going through a divorce. I am hated by my community. I am the last person to help write a book about forgiveness. DJ is on a path of self-destruction and missed Kaden\\u2019s last birthday\\u2014just didn\\u2019t show up for his party. I have no forgiveness in me right now. I want revenge, but revenge is reserved for people who aren\\u2019t on probation. Plus, I have never cowritten a whole book before. The doctor had done a lot of his own writing, and I wrote bits here and there and reworded some of his prose. An entire book feels like too big an endeavor. In my MFA program I only had the patience for writing short stories, and those were short short stories. I have no idea where to begin. \\u201cLet\\u2019s make an outline of Arch\\u2019s philosophy of forgiveness,\\u201d Doug says. \\u201cA blueprint that you can write from.\\u201d He might as well be asking me to speak Mandarin. I\\u2019m a fiction writer by training, and I\\u2019ve never done outlines or blueprints. Some do, of course, but I\\u2019ve never been able to comprehend how you can know the structure of something before you begin writing. I go along with the program, and we loosely sketch out each chapter, questions we need to ask Archbishop Tutu and his daughter Mpho about what forgiveness is and is not. Doug has worked with him before, and they\\u2019ve been talking about this book since before I came to work here, so he has a clear idea what each chapter will be about. My job will be to put it all in beautiful writing once we get the content from the archbishop and Mpho, pull content from his speeches, and find the stories to illustrate the big ideas and each of the key points. The whole outline fits on one sheet of paper. On the back side, we list the four steps to forgiving that are going to form the structure of the book. These have been predetermined. \\u201cThere\\u2019s just one more chapter to figure out,\\u201d says Doug. The whole process has taken less than an hour. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the last chapter?\\u201d \\u201cThe chapter on self-forgiveness.\\u201d I make a face at him. \\u201cWhat?\\u201d he asks, when I sit back in my chair. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know anything about that,\\u201d I say. \\u201cOf course you do.\\u201d I watch him sketch out six key points for the chapter, and then he hands the outline of the whole book to me. \\u201cYou can do this,\\u201d he says. \\u201cAll your experience in jail makes you the absolute best person to cowrite this book.\\u201d I think about Daddy and Kiki and Officer Lonnie and Cassandra. Doug doesn\\u2019t know any of my jail experiences, so it\\u2019s a stretch for him to say that jail made me the best person to help write this book. But I know he\\u2019s trying to hype me up, and I appreciate it. We schedule Skype calls with Archbishop Tutu and Mpho. Because of the time difference the calls are late at night. After Kaden goes to bed, I perch my laptop on my tiny kitchen table and try to angle the camera really high so the yellow fridge four feet behind me doesn\\u2019t show. I take notes while Archbishop Tutu speaks, even though it\\u2019s all being recorded for transcription. We talk through the outline and revise in real time. I can\\u2019t believe Archbishop Tutu is actually in my tiny apartment talking to me. In seventh grade I had done a social studies report on apartheid for my favorite teacher, Mr. Miller. He encouraged me to write every day. I would sit in his class, hiding behind my Farrah Fawcett bangs, and then go home and write stories about all the history lessons he had taught. I wrote a story where I was a soldier in the Vietnam War who didn\\u2019t want to fight. I wrote a story that took place during the Armenian genocide. But when we learned about Archbishop Tutu and apartheid, I had written a full essay and created a presentation with poster board and then given an impassioned speech that I was pretty sure would create fairness and equality in South Africa. Now I\\u2019m on a video conference with the man himself, but I try to play it cool. Archbishop Tutu is kind and loving and wise and funny, and I pay close attention to his quirks of phrasing and his generosity of language. He is a formal speaker whose language is both precise and lofty. I\\u2019ve agreed to do the book, mostly because I don\\u2019t really have a choice, this is the job. But then I procrastinate. I don\\u2019t call it procrastinating, though; I call it deprioritizing the writing part of the book. It\\u2019s not due to the publisher for a year, so I tuck the outline away for as long as possible and instead write more questions for Archbishop Tutu to answer over Skype, and I research forgiveness stories, and I transcribe other talks and do lots of research into the science of forgiveness. When I finally start writing, the early chapters come together easily because I have so much material to work from, but the deadline for delivery is looming, and it\\u2019s time to tackle the chapter on self-forgiveness and that\\u2019s basically all new material for the book. I pull out the chapter outline and read it over again and then I tell Doug I\\u2019m going to a coffee shop to write. The office is small, and Doug talks loudly on the phone, so he wishes me luck and waves me off. \\u201cYou can do this,\\u201d he says as I walk out the door. \\u201cYou can write this chapter.\\u201d I get to the coffee shop at 10 a.m. and settle in at a table that\\u2019s big enough to spread out all my folders and transcripts. I feel important at my big table doing important work, but the blank screen in front of me is terrifying. I give myself an inner pep talk and glance at the clock. I decide I will not leave this coffee shop until the full chapter is written. I start doing calculations in my head. Twenty-five to thirty pages for the chapter, twelve hours until the coffee shop closes, two to three pages an hour, a page every twenty minutes. It all seems reasonable. I think of Doug\\u2019s words: There is no such thing as writer\\u2019s block\\u2014if you are stuck, it just means you don\\u2019t have enough information. I turn it into a game. If I finish three pages before the hour is up, I get to go on Facebook or play Candy Crush until the next hour starts. I race against time and figure I will just get a bad first draft down, and then Doug can edit and make changes. A bad something is better than a great nothing. I realize I trained for this in seventh grade, and I trained for this in jail. My confidence and energy increase. I don\\u2019t always meet the one page in twenty minutes but I am close. I write all day and into the night about how you have to be willing to face the harm you\\u2019ve caused someone, be willing to make amends, and accept that a person may choose to end the relationship even if they choose to forgive you. I only stop to go to the bathroom, buy more coffee, and check on Kaden who is being watched by Cody. The sound of chairs being put away registers as I type the chapter\\u2019s last line. It\\u2019s thirty-two pages long. I don\\u2019t read it over, and instead email it to Doug with disclaimers about how rough it is and how bad it probably is and how we can revise. But inside I feel good. It\\u2019s ten fifteen and I just wrote an entire chapter of a book in one day. A few days later, Doug meets me outside the office when I pull up. \\u201cSit down,\\u201d he says. We sit on the front steps. I can tell I\\u2019m in trouble. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d Doug looks at me seriously. \\u201cWhy does something always have to be wrong?\\u201d \\u201cReally? Do you even know me?\\u201d We both laugh, but I\\u2019m still nervous. \\u201cI read the chapter you wrote,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI know it needs work\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s fucking fantastic.\\u201d \\u201cReally?\\u201d \\u201cReally. I mean, do you know what you just did? It\\u2019s like watching Roger Bannister break the four-minute mile. You just wrote a thirty-plus-page chapter in a day. That\\u2019s not really possible. Only it is possible, and you did it.\\u201d \\u201cWow, I can\\u2019t believe it.\\u201d \\u201cWell, there was one line I cut\\u2014\\u2018the hamster wheel of retribution\\u2019\\u2014that was a little much.\\u201d I shrug and laugh. \\u201cI thought it was clever, but I\\u2019ll fix it.\\u201d \\u201cI already cut it and sent the chapter to Archbishop Tutu.\\u201d \\u201cWhat did he say?\\u201d \\u201cHe said we do a better him than he does.\\u201d When I don\\u2019t respond, Doug clarifies: \\u201cHe loved it, he said to tell you he loved it. We still need to send it to Mpho.\\u201d I am stunned and thrilled. \\u201cYou know,\\u201d I say, \\u201cI was thinking it would be good to test out the forgiveness practices in the book.\\u201d \\u201cHow would we do that?\\u201d \\u201cWell, I could do them with a certain group of people who really need to learn about forgiveness and self-forgiveness.\\u201d Doug thinks for a few seconds and then nods. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a great idea. We can see which practices really resonate with people. What\\u2019s the group?\\u201d \\u201cThe Gemma Program. I can volunteer to do a course on forgiveness with the girls in jail.\\u201d \\u201cLara, I think that\\u2019s a really good idea. For them and for you.\\u201d Cynthia agrees with the idea as well. When I walk in the first day it feels surreal. Sandy, the social worker who was hired to run Gemma after I was fired, is warm and welcoming. I only recognize one girl from my time in G, but I can\\u2019t remember her name. \\u201cHi,\\u201d I say. \\u201cMy name is Lara.\\u201d \\u201cMama Love,\\u201d the woman yells and laughs. I look around the room. \\u201cThat was my nickname, and I\\u2019m a graduate of the Gemma Program.\\u201d This gets their attention. \\u201cI work for a literary agency now, and I\\u2019m working on a project called The Book of Forgiving with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Mpho Tutu. Does anyone know who Archbishop Tutu is?\\u201d Only one woman raises her hand\\u2014an older woman of about sixty. \\u201cWhen did you get out?\\u201d another woman asks. \\u201cAlmost four years ago,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI was the first one out on the work-release program.\\u201d The women pepper me with questions about how long it took me to get a job, and did I have a home, and was I still on probation. I answer them all and confirm yes, I\\u2019m still on probation. \\u201cDoes the guy you\\u2019re helping with the book know?\\u201d \\u201cMy boss knows, but Archbishop Tutu doesn\\u2019t know. But he\\u2019s an expert on forgiveness so I think he would be okay with it.\\u201d I am sure this is true, but I\\u2019m also sure that I don\\u2019t want him or Mpho to find out. I don\\u2019t want any of the authors we work with to find out. I\\u2019m afraid of what they would think of me. I\\u2019m afraid of them thinking less of me. I don\\u2019t say any of this to the Gemma women, but instead tell them about Tutu and apartheid, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and how mothers forgave the men who killed their sons. \\u201cThe book has a lot of forgiveness exercises, prayers, and meditations that Mpho Tutu wrote, and I\\u2019d like to try them out with all of you and have you tell me if they\\u2019re helpful or not. That will help us decide what to put in the book.\\u201d \\u201cYou mean if we don\\u2019t like them they won\\u2019t go in the book?\\u201d \\u201cProbably not. They might try to improve them or find better ones. And if you\\u2019re okay with it, some of the stories you share over the next six weeks might be used in the book. I would change your name, of course.\\u201d The older woman raises her hand and asks softly, \\u201cIf we wanted you to use our name, could you?\\u201d I get choked up at her question because I understand everything she\\u2019s not saying. \\u201cOf course. If you want your name in the book, it will be in the book.\\u201d There\\u2019s only time left for me to read Mpho Tutu\\u2019s opening prayer about forgiveness called \\u201cThe Prayer Before the Prayer.\\u201d I want to be willing to let go, to forgive. But dare not ask for the will to forgive, in case you give it to me And I am not yet ready. I am not yet ready for my heart to soften. I am not yet ready to be vulnerable again. Not yet ready to see that there is humanity in my tormentor\\u2019s eyes Or that the one who hurt me may also have cried I am not yet ready for the journey. I am not yet interested in the path I am at the prayer before the prayer of forgiveness Grant me the will to want to forgive. Grant it to me not yet but soon Can I even form the words? Forgive me? Dare I even look? Do I dare to see the hurt I have caused: I can glimpse all the shattered pieces of that fragile thing That soul trying to rise on the broken wings of hope But only out of the corner of my eye. I am afraid of it. And if I am afraid to see How can I not be afraid to say: Forgive me? Is there a place where we can meet? You and me The place in the middle where we straddle the lines Where you are right and I am right too. And both of us are wrong and wronged Can we meet there? And look for the place where the path begins The path that ends when we forgive. Several of the women start to cry, and the moment feels bigger than this little room. After a few moments of silence, I break the tension. \\u201cSo that one\\u2019s a keeper then?\\u201d I get the women journals, and for one hour a week for the next six weeks we meet and do the forgiveness exercises. The women are thrilled to be part of a book project, and I understand their thrill. It\\u2019s the thrill of feeling like you matter. Like you are part of something bigger than your own sad story. The exercises on asking for forgiveness are hard, as is the discussion about how you have to tell the truth about what you did and then hear the truth about the harm you caused others. But the topic of self-forgiveness is the hardest, especially within a punitive system. The women are hard on themselves, guilty and ashamed and frustrated at the choices they\\u2019ve made in life, and I advise them to forgive themselves so they can move on. I tell them that Archbishop Tutu says that telling the truth, witnessing the harm you\\u2019ve caused, and asking for forgiveness, even if it\\u2019s not given, is the path to freedom. It\\u2019s the only way to not be bitter. To not hate yourself so you can have a fighting chance to be something beyond the worst things you\\u2019ve done. I teach what I\\u2019m not brave enough to do myself. Even out of the system, it\\u2019s hard not to stew in the juices of punishment and feel like it\\u2019s where I belong. When the book goes to print, I read the acknowledgments section and see Archbishop Tutu has paid tribute to me as his literary companion through many drafts and he calls me an aptly named genius with a heart of gold. It feels good to see my name in his book, to show it to my boys. Chapter by chapter, book by book, I am creating a new legacy to pass on to my children. I am the neighbor from hell in the newspaper, but I am also the person in the acknowledgments of the books I help create. I am officially a ghostwriter, and finishing any chapter feels like being high, only different. The edges are full of confidence, and that makes it nothing like the high of opiates, which were only outlined in glittery fear and false bravado. This feeling will return every time I finish writing a chapter for the next eight years\\u2014a feeling I will chase like I used to chase drugs. My phone rings late one night. When I see Darcy\\u2019s name on the caller ID, I quickly slip out of bed and go into the bathroom so I don\\u2019t wake Kaden. I answer the phone with a question. \\u201cAre the boys okay?\\u201d \\u201cWhat? Hi.\\u201d \\u201cAre the boys okay?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why she\\u2019s calling me so late, so of course I am assuming bad news. \\u201cYeah, they\\u2019re fine.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, good.\\u201d I fall silent, and she does too. Over time, we have established a truce of sorts. We took a picture together when Cody graduated high school. We all went to dinner together the night before Dylan went off to study abroad in South Korea. It was easy to fall back into casual friendliness with Bryan; he doesn\\u2019t have the attention span to hold a grudge. I am still wary of Darcy, though, and whenever we\\u2019re all together, I end up feeling bad about myself. I told them about my job at Idea Architects in a voice I didn\\u2019t like. I sounded hungry for their approval, and they looked at me in a way that made me feel like I was lying. I try to focus on the fact that Bryan and Darcy saved Kaden from foster care with strangers while I was in jail. But I still can\\u2019t forget all the ways she hurt me when I was hurting. Darcy takes a deep breath, and I steel myself for another false accusation of some sort. I hate conflict, and especially late-night conflict. I am working on five books at once, and I need what little sleep I can get. \\u201cI had therapy today,\\u201d she says. I remain silent as I sit down on the edge of the tub and play with the snorkel and goggles Kaden likes to wear in the bath. \\u201cMy therapist says you and I should hang out more.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d Darcy starts to cry. \\u201cYou\\u2019re the only one I can trust in Santa Cruz,\\u201d she says. \\u201cBryan is cheating on me.\\u201d This news does not surprise me. The fact that I am the only one she can trust shocks me. \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry,\\u201d I say. I don\\u2019t tell her that I suspected as much when I saw Bryan constantly texting during one of Cody\\u2019s basketball games. There was a certain look of excitement mixed with chagrin that is Bryan\\u2019s cheating face. \\u201cBut you have lots of friends,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWhy does your therapist think I\\u2019m the only one you can trust?\\u201d \\u201cBecause you\\u2019ve been through this before, you know what I\\u2019m going through, you\\u2019re the only one who can understand. Besides, my friends here are his friends too.\\u201d Darcy is from Boston, so all her real friends are far away. I don\\u2019t know what to advise her. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard,\\u201d I say, \\u201cbut you\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d This makes her cry harder. I am in no position to be the therapist for my ex-husband\\u2019s soon-to-be-ex-wife who I think may have tried to get me sent to prison. \\u201cI can\\u2019t get out of bed,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI\\u2019m so depressed.\\u201d I tune out while she sets forth the gory details of Bryan\\u2019s affair. It\\u2019s not my business, and I\\u2019m no scientist, but I bet the research shows that when you marry a cheater, there\\u2019s a good chance he\\u2019s going to cheat on you. As a woman, I feel for her. As a person once married to her husband, I feel for her. A petty part of me clutches a bit of schadenfreude, but I set that aside. \\u201cTry to sleep,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI\\u2019ll call you this weekend.\\u201d The next day I talk to Ty, who tells me she won\\u2019t get out of bed. On Sunday, I call her. It\\u2019s Mother\\u2019s Day, which is a tough day for her anyway because she couldn\\u2019t bear children of her own. She doesn\\u2019t answer. I call Ty again; he says his dad is out, and Darcy is still in bed. I pack up Kaden and we make the short drive over to their house. I park Kaden with Ty, walk upstairs to her bedroom, and knock. A weak voice says, \\u201cCome in.\\u201d She is sitting up in bed. Her eyes are red-rimmed and swollen. I quickly take in a pile of pill bottles and crumpled tissues on the nightstand. She looks like shit. \\u201cHow are you?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cI brought you something.\\u201d I hold out a coffee cup to her. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a mocha.\\u201d \\u201cThanks,\\u201d she says. \\u201cHappy Mother\\u2019s Day.\\u201d She starts to cry again, and I sit on the bed next to her with my own coffee. \\u201cLook, I know it seems like the world is ending, but you can\\u2019t just stay in bed. Ty said you\\u2019ve been in here for a couple of days.\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t get up,\\u201d she says. She sounds groggy, and I try to read the labels on her pill bottles without being obvious about it. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a beautiful day,\\u201d I say. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go for a walk on the beach.\\u201d She looks at me blankly, and I\\u2019m surprised at my suggestion as well. I was just going to hand her a coffee and then slip out. But she\\u2019s a mess. I was a mess too. Like recognizes like. \\u201cCome on,\\u201d I say, \\u201cit\\u2019ll be fun. It\\u2019s beautiful outside.\\u201d It\\u2019s actually kind of cold and foggy but now is not the time for the truth. I stand up from the bed and hold out my hand. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go,\\u201d I say. \\u201cLet\\u2019s just go for a walk. And Kaden\\u2019s downstairs; he really wanted to wish you a Happy Mother\\u2019s Day.\\u201d That\\u2019s another lie, but I\\u2019m desperate enough to throw Kaden under this bus. I had to bribe him with the promise of Legos to get him to come with me. Darcy reaches for my hand. I want to feel the compassion I\\u2019m faking, and when she stands up and stumbles a little, I suddenly do. I don\\u2019t want to be a woman who kicks another woman when she\\u2019s down. I want to be better than she was to me so she can be better than she was to me. Kaden doesn\\u2019t want to walk with us, so we make our way to the beach alone. Darcy stops every few houses to tell me a Bryan story from when they first met, when they once took a walk here, when they were once in love. I just listen and hold space for the betrayal she\\u2019s feeling. Bryan isn\\u2019t a bad guy, and a part of me is surprised he lasted this long with the bitterness that\\u2019s simmered between them for years, but I still support her as she complains about the unfairness of it all and repeats everything she already told me over the phone. We have just turned around to head back to the house. She\\u2019s vented all there is to vent for now, so we walk in silence, and it\\u2019s actually pretty nice. I haven\\u2019t walked with a friend on the beach in years. \\u201cI met someone,\\u201d I offer. I\\u2019m still wary of trusting her with personal information, but I want to build a bridge, and this is good gossip. \\u201cWhat? Who? Tell me everything!\\u201d \\u201cHis name is Sam. He\\u2019s great, but he\\u2019s seven years younger than me, so I don\\u2019t know\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cBryan is seven years younger than me\\u2026\\u201d she says and then falls silent. We both know how that\\u2019s turning out. \\u201cI hope he\\u2019s a nice guy,\\u201d says Darcy before she starts crying again. \\u201cI hope he is too,\\u201d I say as I put my arm around her shoulders. Sam does seem like a nice guy; he drops coffee at my doorstep every morning on his way to work. He has two children from a previous marriage whom he dotes on. Since DJ, I\\u2019ve tried dating two other men. The first lied to me about being almost divorced; in fact, he wasn\\u2019t even separated. The other also turned out to be a liar, and when I broke it off with him, he threatened to call Probation on me. Both were men I met in recovery meetings who were supposed to be practicing the principles of honesty. I had sworn off dating and relationships forever, but then I saw Sam and he saw me. And I liked the person I was in his eyes. I liked that he seemed to love and adore me, but it was still new, and I hadn\\u2019t yet told him much about the life I was struggling to leave behind. I told the boys to make Darcy breakfast before we left. When we return, we both climb into her bed, and the boys carry in our breakfast on matching wooden trays. I think about the boys coming to visit me at Blaine on Mother\\u2019s Day. At the time, I was so happy to spend the day with them, I hadn\\u2019t realized that my time with them meant Darcy had spent the day alone. But here we were years later, spending Mother\\u2019s Day together with all four boys. Sometimes, the path of forgiveness doesn\\u2019t look anything like we think it will. Sometimes it looks a lot like runny scrambled eggs and overly buttered sourdough toast. After breakfast, the boys take the trays away and I get up to leave. \\u201cYou going to be okay?\\u201d I ask. Darcy nods. \\u201cYou know,\\u201d she says, \\u201cI never told you or anyone this, but I\\u2019ve had my own struggles\\u2026\\u201d I think about her anger, her vitriol, her seeming delight at my failure. I think about her leading the mob in the courtroom, and it suddenly all makes sense. Maybe she hated me for all the complicated reasons we hate people who are more like us than we can admit. Or maybe she never hated me at all. Sam comes over later that evening, after Kaden is asleep. His kids are with their mom, and when I open the door he is standing there in his work boots holding a bouquet of flowers and a bunch of carrots. I tell him about my day with Darcy. And then I tell him about my Mother\\u2019s Day in jail with the boys, my arrest, my time in jail, the newspaper headline, and Doug googling me. He doesn\\u2019t say a word until I\\u2019m done. \\u201cThanks for telling me all that. I\\u2019m sorry you went through it, but I think you\\u2019re amazing. Your past doesn\\u2019t matter to me.\\u201d \\u201cWhy?\\u201d \\u201cI only care about who you are now. And I can promise you one thing, I will never google you. I don\\u2019t need to.\\u201d How could I not fall in love with a man who refused to google me? A few weeks later, Darcy, Bryan, and I stand awkwardly together for pictures at Ty\\u2019s high school graduation. At the dinner that night, Darcy gets drunk, and the tension between them overshadows the celebration. I yell at her for making the night about her rather than Ty, and then I immediately apologize. That dinner is the last time I see Darcy before she and Bryan officially separate and she moves back to Boston. I send her love and light and wish her well. I don\\u2019t know what next year\\u2019s Mother\\u2019s Day will bring. I know I will gladly share my Mother\\u2019s Day with the women in jail, with Darcy in her bed, and with whoever comes after her as stepmother to my children. I forgive Darcy and I hope she forgives me. \\n chapter 18 A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD Idea Architects has outgrown Doug\\u2019s home office, so we relocate across the county and I move out of my chair and into a real desk. I am writing a book with a neurosurgeon, so early every Friday morning I drive to Silicon Valley and meet him at his office before he goes into surgery. On one Friday morning I accompany him to the hospital and change into scrubs so I can be in the operating room while he performs brain surgery. I ask him if I can keep the scrubs and when he says yes, I wear them often over the next two months while I work with him on the book. In the middle of this new book I\\u2019m under deadline for, Sam and I decide to move in together and Doug rents us his house while he moves to a house closer to our new office. Neither Sam nor I want to get married again. Sam\\u2019s only been married once, but I\\u2019ve been married twice, and I don\\u2019t think I have a third time in me. I\\u2019m not Elizabeth Taylor. Although secretly a part of me at least wants Sam to want to marry me, plus I am curious about what it would be like to be married for ten years, twenty years, thirty years. But a larger part of me doubts I have it in me to stay married that long. I have never made it to five years before, so maybe I am Elizabeth Taylor. Kaden and I carefully pack up all his Legos and drive behind the U-Haul to our new home. It\\u2019s a big change from our four-hundred-square-foot apartment, and I\\u2019m excited and nervous. The new home is in a nice neighborhood and near the elementary school that Kaden and Sam\\u2019s son, Chase, will attend. They are only a year and a half apart, and for the two years that Sam and I have been dating, they\\u2019ve acted like they were at a slumber party whenever they were together. I hope that rapport will continue now that they\\u2019re sharing a room. I am grateful he will now have siblings close to his age and a house full of company, instead of just me and my hypervigilance. Sam\\u2019s daughter, Dahlia, will have her own room, and the house has an extra guest room for Dylan, Cody, and Ty to stay in when they want to. It\\u2019s taken five years, but I finally have a home that can hold all my children. They\\u2019re all out of high school now and Ty will be off to college soon after traveling post\\u2013high school, but we\\u2019ll have the holidays together. I love being a day-to-day mom again. I love setting the table for dinner, watching a movie together. When I have to sweep the floors and do the dishes I tell myself to be grateful I am doing these things in my own home and not in Blaine Street. Work keeps me busy, and I often pull one all-nighter a week just to keep up. But apart from the occasional brain surgery with an author, I feel like I have finally found the nice, conventional life I have longed for since my arrest. I didn\\u2019t appreciate what I had before, so now I relish the domesticity of it all. The comfort, the security, the neighbors who wave to me when I drive by. Ty, Kaden, and I pick up take-out dinner a few days after we move in. It\\u2019s a celebration, and we\\u2019re in high spirits. I have just made the turn off the freeway at our exit when flashing blue and red lights appear behind us. I quickly pull into a parking lot. I know I\\u2019ve done nothing wrong, but the terror is instantaneous. My body remembers my arrest, even if my mind knows not to worry. Ty seems unconcerned, and I glance over my shoulder at Kaden in the back seat. He is staring out the window. \\u201cIt will be fine,\\u201d I say. Ty moves to take his seat belt off, but I tell him to leave it on. Because we are in an unincorporated part of the county, a sheriff\\u2019s deputy has pulled me over. I am grateful I don\\u2019t recognize the deputy when he walks up to my window. I am grateful it isn\\u2019t one of the two who arrested me, or one of the deputies who works in the jail. I remind myself that I am just a mom driving home from picking up takeout with her children. He shines his flashlight at the boys, and then stands next to my rolled-down window without saying a word. \\u201cHi?\\u201d I say, waiting to see why he pulled me over. \\u201cYou have a taillight out,\\u201d he says. \\u201cOh no, I didn\\u2019t realize\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cCould I see your driver\\u2019s license and insurance?\\u201d I dig my license out of my bag and ask Ty to get the registration from the glove box. The deputy shines his flashlight in Ty\\u2019s face again. \\u201cIs this your son?\\u201d \\u201cYes,\\u201d I say. Ty gives him a fake smile. Kaden hasn\\u2019t said a word. He takes my license and registration and walks back to his car. A second deputy I hadn\\u2019t noticed before stands behind my car. \\u201cIt will just be a fix-it ticket,\\u201d I say. \\u201cNo big deal.\\u201d Kaden is staring down at his lap. \\u201cYou okay, baby guy?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing to worry about.\\u201d I wonder if he\\u2019s thinking about the last time he saw me with the police when I told him everything would be okay. Our dinner is getting cold. We\\u2019ve been sitting in the car for close to twenty minutes, and the two deputies are outside the car talking when suddenly five more sheriff\\u2019s cars pull into the parking lot, their sirens blaring and lights flashing. Two of them pull in front of our car, blocking our way forward. The other three line up behind and around the car that pulled us over. Two officers get out of each car and stand at the back of my car. Ty is starting to look nervous now, and Kaden still hasn\\u2019t uttered a word. The deputy comes back to the window. \\u201cYou\\u2019re on probation. You don\\u2019t have any violations, but we\\u2019ve called your probation officer.\\u201d \\u201cFor a burned-out light?\\u201d The only reason I\\u2019m still on probation is the fact that I haven\\u2019t been able to pay the remainder of the restitution back yet. \\u201cWe have the right to search you and your car, but we\\u2019re waiting to hear back from your probation officer.\\u201d \\u201cYou can search my car,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m fine if you search my car, you don\\u2019t have to wait for him to call back.\\u201d The deputy seems surprised at this. He walks back to confer with the other ten officers who have assembled to deal with our broken light. Another deputy walks up to the car and asks us to get out. Ty opens Kaden\\u2019s door and I grab the bag of Chipotle so at least we can eat. \\u201cLeave everything in the car!\\u201d Apparently they need to search our dinner. Ty, Kaden, and I sit on a curb in the flashing lights while they pull everything out of the glove box and the trunk. My backpack gets dumped on the hood of the car while three deputies shine their flashlights under the seats, between the seats, across the dash, and inside the car doors. I am scared and embarrassed, but mostly I\\u2019m worried about Kaden. He has climbed into my lap and buried his ten-year-old face in my neck. He is shivering even though the night is warm. I rub his back. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, Boodle,\\u201d says Ty, using his favorite nickname for his little brother. After another twenty minutes, the original deputy walks up and hands me my documents along with a fix-it ticket for the light. \\u201cYou know we could impound it for the broken light.\\u201d I don\\u2019t reply and he looks at me like he\\u2019s waiting for me to thank him. But I feel no gratitude and say nothing. I feel only anger at this man, and all his buddies, and the system he represents that could ruin my happy, hard-won life over a five-dollar taillight. \\u201cYour probation officer said you\\u2019re good to go. That\\u2019s quite a record you have.\\u201d I don\\u2019t have to check in with Probation anymore; I just file a monthly report online. So I\\u2019d almost forgotten that I can still be sent back to jail for anything at any time. I had thought about homeschooling Kaden earlier in the year but found out I can\\u2019t because I have a record. I am ghostwriting a book for two Stanford professors, but I can\\u2019t homeschool my son. We gather up all our stuff and put the car back together as quickly as possible after the deputies leave. The sirens, the flashing lights, the six sheriff\\u2019s cars\\u2014it all feels like intentional overkill. Do I look that dangerous sitting in a car with my two children and a bag of Chipotle? They knew when they looked me up that I had never violated probation for five years, but still they acted as if I had just robbed a bank and was driving the getaway car. \\u201cLet\\u2019s just order pizza,\\u201d I say as we head home. When I tell Sam what happened, he\\u2019s angry with the police on my behalf. I try to explain to him how scared I am every day that people will find out about my past, but he doesn\\u2019t get it. \\u201cWho cares?\\u201d he asks. \\u201cWhy does it even matter?\\u201d He has never been arrested, never gone to jail, and he can\\u2019t seem to understand the terror that lives right under the surface of my happy life. I can\\u2019t sleep that night. At 2 a.m. I get out of bed and decide to check my email. There\\u2019s a note from Doug saying our next-door neighbors are upset with him for renting to me without talking to them first. A friend of another neighbor, someone I know from recovery meetings, gossiped about me, and now all the neighbors know the neighbor from hell has moved next door. \\u201cLet\\u2019s discuss in the morning,\\u201d writes Doug. \\u201cBut I told them I\\u2019m free to meet on Saturday.\\u201d When Sam gets up for work at five, I am sitting at the kitchen table. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d he asks. \\u201cBobby told the neighbors across the street about my past and he told another neighbor who told another neighbor. And now Zack and Karen are upset and want a meeting to discuss it with us and Doug.\\u201d I start to cry. I should have stayed in my little apartment with Kaden. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have to defend where we live to anyone.\\u201d \\u201cDoug wants us to all sit down and talk.\\u201d \\u201cNo way,\\u201d says Sam. \\u201cFuck the neighbors. You\\u2019ve been in this neighborhood, this house, all day every day for years working with Doug, and they haven\\u2019t had a problem.\\u201d \\u201cUntil Bobby made sure they knew my past.\\u201d \\u201cFucking Bobby,\\u201d says Sam. \\u201cIsn\\u2019t he supposed to keep things anonymous?\\u201d I just shrug. \\u201cWill you go to the meeting with me and Doug?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cOn Saturday?\\u201d Sam is quiet for a moment, and then he says no. In a way I\\u2019m relieved. I don\\u2019t want him to witness my humiliation. \\u201cI disagree with the need to meet on principle, and there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going to give them the satisfaction. You do not have to defend your past. Besides, I have to work on Saturday.\\u201d I\\u2019ve never been able to make Sam understand the burden I carry. Going to jail, the newspaper headline, probation\\u2014it\\u2019s all a secret I keep from everyone I know except him and Doug and my family. In Sam\\u2019s mind, the past is past; it has no bearing on our present or future. I appreciate this Tolle-level detachment, but it also makes me feel alone as I face my next hurdle. The prospect of this meeting makes me fearful and nervous. Doug shows up at the house full of his usual energy and goodwill. Zack and Karen have set out a fruit plate, and we sit awkwardly at their kitchen table. \\u201cLisa and Will didn\\u2019t want to come to the meeting,\\u201d they say, referring to the neighbors across the street who spread the gossip. \\u201cWill objects to it. He says you can live where you want to live, and it\\u2019s not our business. Obviously, we understand his point but disagree that it\\u2019s not our business. Doug, you should have told us before you rented the house.\\u201d Doug smiles. \\u201cWell, actually I didn\\u2019t need to do that. And you\\u2019ve known Lara for years now. It never crossed my mind to tell you. We trust Lara with our home, our business. Besides marrying my wife, the best thing I\\u2019ve ever done is hire Lara.\\u201d My eyes fill with tears. Karen and Zack nod in some kind of agreement with Doug\\u2019s sentiment, but they still ask to hear my story. I tell them I have many years in recovery but go silent after that. I don\\u2019t know what to say. I am suddenly exhausted, and I realize Sam is right, I don\\u2019t need to defend myself. I shouldn\\u2019t have to defend myself. Doug steps in and tells them I committed identity theft and went to jail but how responsible I am now. \\u201cGiven my job, you can understand my concern,\\u201d says Zack. I don\\u2019t know what he does for a living, and Doug seems to have forgotten as well. We both look at him, puzzled. \\u201cI do cybersecurity,\\u201d he says. \\u201cObviously, identity theft is a big part of what I fight every day.\\u201d I\\u2019m not going to steal his identity. I\\u2019m too busy working at my job assuming the identities of our authors and writing their books. \\u201cYou have my word,\\u201d says Doug. \\u201cThere will be no problems whatsoever\\u2014Lara is a perfect neighbor.\\u201d Karen and Zack seem dubious but say okay, as if they are being magnanimous in letting me live where I live. Before we leave, they both backtrack on the whole meeting and remind us of how committed they are to social justice issues. I tune them out. I want to go to my new home in my new neighborhood and cry. We say our goodbyes, and Doug emails me the next morning: How are you \\u201cthe morning after\\u2026\\u201d? Hope you are still feeling that the meeting went as well as I did. I hope you will feel at home in the new neighborhood, and I do feel that going through experiences like this and the kind of honesty everyone shared yesterday deepens relationships significantly. I send a smiley face emoji back, but as I walk Kaden to school on Monday the neighborhood doesn\\u2019t look as shiny and hopeful as it did the week before. Not long after, Sam and I are sitting in the backyard enjoying a Saturday night at home without the kids. Dylan, Cody, and Ty have taken Kaden on a road trip to Oregon for the week. It\\u2019s a rare summer night without fog, and I feel content. It\\u2019s a feeling I\\u2019m still not a hundred percent comfortable with but I\\u2019m trying. Sam starts to say something and then stops. He seems nervous, and my contentment leaves as I brace myself for whatever shoe is about to drop. \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d \\u201cNothing\\u2019s wrong.\\u201d I wait him out, thinking suddenly that he\\u2019s about to break up with me. I start to ponder how I\\u2019m going to pay the rent myself, and vow never to get in a relationship again. In an instant, I play out our entire breakup and I\\u2019m surprised at how much it hurts, how much I really do love him. \\u201cWill you marry me?\\u201d \\u201cYou want to marry me?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cYou want to get married?\\u201d \\u201cI do.\\u201d \\u201cBut why? You said you never wanted to get married again.\\u201d \\u201cI want to marry you, I love you, can you please just answer the question?\\u201d Sam is laughing now. \\u201cI want to marry you, too, so yes, the answer is yes!\\u201d Sam howls at the night sky. I jump up and throw my arms around him. We kiss, and he howls again, and I don\\u2019t care about the neighbors next door and what they\\u2019ll think, or how I\\u2019ve failed at marriage in the past. All I know is that I love him and he loves me, and it feels so good to feel chosen. We make plans to get married the following June and spend the fall and winter planning a big wedding. One night in March, as we\\u2019re about to go to sleep, I tell him I can\\u2019t see our wedding. \\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d \\u201cI mean, I know we\\u2019re making these plans, but I don\\u2019t see it. I don\\u2019t see us at this big wedding, and you know how I am\\u2026 If I can\\u2019t see something happening it never happens.\\u201d Sam is quiet for a moment. \\u201cPlus, I hate the word venue,\\u201d I add. \\u201cIf someone asks about our \\u2018venue\\u2019 one more time, I\\u2019m going to lose it on them. It\\u2019s a horrible, horrible word.\\u201d \\u201cDo you want to marry me still?\\u201d \\u201cOf course,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWhat if we elope?\\u201d We already have a wedding party, and people helping us plan the wedding, and Sam\\u2019s parents would be devastated. Plus, I want the boys at our wedding. Eloping seems impossible. Sam sits up in bed. \\u201cLet\\u2019s just do it. The day after tomorrow. We\\u2019ll take a long weekend. Just us. We can do a party later with the family.\\u201d It feels so wrong, but also so right. Planning a wedding in a day feels way easier to me than planning a wedding over a year. We try to sneak off, but twenty-one people, including Dylan, Cody, Ty, and Sam\\u2019s parents, decide to elope with us on a day\\u2019s notice. It\\u2019s crazy and chaotic and fun and perfect. On our wedding night Sam and I stand at the window of our hotel room looking out at the lights of Reno, Nevada. \\u201cI hope you know how special this is,\\u201d I say. \\u201cOf course I know. I love you, Mrs. Lara Love Hardin.\\u201d \\u201cNo,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThis is the first time I\\u2019ve gotten married without getting pregnant first. This is a big moment in a girl\\u2019s life.\\u201d Sam looks at me in silence for a moment, and then we both laugh. I have begun a marriage with laughter, and I take this as a good omen. \\n chapter 19 THE DALAI LAMA HATES ME Doug decides to sell his house, and Sam and I find a rental home a few blocks from where I used to live with Kaden. It\\u2019s hard to find a place to rent that has enough room to fit all the kids, takes a dog, and doesn\\u2019t require a criminal background check. I barely have time to unpack in our new place before I\\u2019m on my way to India to work on The Book of Joy with Doug, Archbishop Tutu, the Dalai Lama, and other members of our growing company. We have moved into even bigger offices, and I was excited for the business trip of a lifetime. No one else at our company knows about my past. None of the many authors I have written books with know about my past. I keep my secret and pray daily that our authors don\\u2019t find out. I am constantly worried that if people know, it will hurt our reputation as a literary agency and that will somehow torpedo the business. Maybe I am overreacting, but I don\\u2019t want to find out. Mostly I am just constantly ashamed, and I also don\\u2019t want people to see me through the lens of being a felon. Am I smart, or am I just smart for a criminal? Am I a good writer, or am I a good writer for someone who was an addict? I also manage the company\\u2019s money, and I don\\u2019t want my honesty and integrity to be questioned. Yes, I keep the secret to protect the business, but I also keep it to protect myself. Two of the books I have cowritten had become New York Times bestsellers\\u2014I am Idea Architects\\u2019 secret weapon, and I guard my secret past like I used to guard my drug addiction. Secrets are a lonely place to live, though, and I can\\u2019t imagine making new friends. There are too many gaps in my life story that don\\u2019t lend themselves to long, getting-to-know-you talks. I don\\u2019t want to feel like I am lying to anyone, even by omission. And I am too ashamed to think about telling the truth. I can\\u2019t face the horror I imagine crossing the faces of people who might find out my secret. I worry about people judging me because I am constantly in judgment of myself. I work on a book where the authors cite research that shows how having close female friends is a huge predictor of a woman\\u2019s health and longevity. The more female friends a woman has, the better. My takeaway from this is that lonely old me is going to suffer a miserable early death if I don\\u2019t make some friends, but I am afraid to try. So I work day and night to clear my karma, and prove that I am good because I do good work. I\\u2019m not really worried about being judged in any afterlife, just in the one I am living. I\\u2019m still on probation because I haven\\u2019t paid the restitution back in full. I apply for my passport and my visa, not knowing if they\\u2019ll get approved. I do research on whether foreign governments do background checks on visa applicants; some do and some don\\u2019t. My visa for the trip to India is denied at first. I had written \\u201cWriter\\u201d as my profession, so I reapply and change my profession to \\u201cSecretary\\u201d and it gets approved. I don\\u2019t have time for feminist outrage because the logistics of bringing an entire team to the Dalai Lama\\u2019s house are all-consuming. I am excited and nervous but mostly excited. I reach out to a friend from my early soccer-mom days who is a devout Buddhist and follower of the Dalai Lama. Over tea, she gives me a crash course on how to behave with monks. \\u201cYou\\u2019re a woman, so they won\\u2019t shake your hand or touch you,\\u201d she says. \\u201cThat just makes me want to shake their hands so I can pull them into the twenty-first century.\\u201d \\u201cPlease don\\u2019t.\\u201d \\u201cHis Holiness sees everything,\\u201d she says. \\u201cHe has this way of knowing you because he can look right into your soul. Listen carefully when he speaks. He will tell you exactly what you most need to hear.\\u201d I don\\u2019t like the idea of the Dalai Lama mucking around in my soul, rummaging around like a girlfriend going through her boyfriend\\u2019s drawers when he\\u2019s not home. Mostly I\\u2019m afraid of what he might see in there. I worry that he will blow my cover. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really special that you get to do this,\\u201d says my old friend, Kate. \\u201cUsually it takes a lot of merit to have an opportunity like this.\\u201d I shrug, unsure how to address my merit or lack thereof. \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s my job, and I know it\\u2019s an amazing opportunity,\\u201d I say eventually. \\u201cHmmm\\u2026\\u201d says Kate, looking at me suspiciously like I\\u2019m passing counterfeit merit. We talk about the travel and what India is like, and Kate shares her stories from Dharamsala and elsewhere. Her work as an educator is based on the Dalai Lama\\u2019s vision for children. I haven\\u2019t seen her since my older boys were in a Buddhist preschool with her kids. At the time, we were part of a close-knit group of moms. I\\u2019m grateful to her for giving me so much of her time and expertise after all those years. At the end of our tea, Kate tells me that most of our old friend group is coming over for a game night at her house. I get excited at the thought of seeing my former best friends. And I love game nights. I realize how much I miss having friends\\u2014how much I miss this group of friends in particular and being in a large group of women in general. It\\u2019s the one thing I miss about jail. \\u201cThey\\u2019ll be here soon,\\u201d Kate says. I nod enthusiastically and give her a big smile. She stands and picks up our teacups. \\u201cSo you\\u2019ll probably want to get going now. I can\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s gotten so late.\\u201d \\u201cOh, of course.\\u201d My face flushes, and I hug her awkwardly. \\u201cOne more thing,\\u201d she says. \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDid you ever steal Pali\\u2019s traveler\\u2019s checks?\\u201d Pali is her daughter. \\u201cN\\u2026 n\\u2026 o,\\u201d I stammer. \\u201cOkay, then,\\u201d she says. In the days leading up to the trip, I alternate between worrying about my merit, which I learn is another word for karma, and what the Dalai Lama might see when he looks in my soul. When I\\u2019m not worrying about my soul, I also fantasize that when he meets me for the first time he will instantly recognize me as special. He will see me as good. Or he will see me as bad. My fantasy life is very flexible. Andrew, my colleague, and I are flying business class to India and I\\u2019m terrified. As he orders champagne, I imagine being arrested or turned back. I\\u2019m afraid of what will happen when I show my passport to enter the country. Will the system light up with bells and sirens? I\\u2019ve gotten permission from Probation to leave the country, but I haven\\u2019t gotten permission from India to enter as a person on probation. Andrew doesn\\u2019t know that he\\u2019s traveling with a felon, and probably wouldn\\u2019t care if I told him, given how much champagne he\\u2019s had, but my anxiety gets worse as we proceed across the Pacific. When we stop to change planes in Hong Kong, I have my first true flash of excitement. Even if I get turned around in India, I am now someone who changes planes in Hong Kong, and that feels like a win for the women in G. We are meeting up with a film crew in New Delhi and going early to set up for the dialogue between Archbishop Tutu and the Dalai Lama. Doug will be interviewing them along with Thupten Jinpa, the Dalai Lama\\u2019s longtime translator, and all will be filmed and transcribed into content for the book Doug will write with them and possibly for a film. My job includes all things logistical: scouting with the film crew, coordinating hotels and guests, making sure everything goes as planned, reviewing the questions Doug is going to ask each day, and general crisis management for the entire team. So far, I am the only one in crisis. The ultimate goal is to take the outline Doug and I created with Jinpa and get enough content during the week to fill a book. When we land in Hong Kong for our connecting flight there are two flight agents outside the gate holding signs with my name and Andrew\\u2019s on them. I panic and turn back to reboard the plane. \\u201cMs. Love?\\u201d I turn around slowly and nod. \\u201cWe have rerouted you to New Delhi. The headwinds caused you to miss your connection so now you will travel to Bangalore, go through immigration, and then transfer to another flight to New Delhi. Follow us, please.\\u201d While Andrew snores, I spend the flight from Hong Kong to Bangalore wondering what prison is like in India. When we land, the immigration line moves quickly, and my throat goes dry when the officer asks me the purpose of my visit. \\u201cWork,\\u201d I squeak out. I can see him noticing my nerves, but he shrugs and stamps my passport. When the time comes for me to meet the Dalai Lama, I prepare my mind with only good thoughts so he doesn\\u2019t go looking into the corners of my dark past. My heart is pounding as he makes his way along a reception line of sorts. I am so ready for my big moment, for him to gaze into my eyes and clear the room so we can talk. When he gets to me, he glances at me and nods slightly. And that\\u2019s it. That night I join Doug and Archbishop Tutu and some dignitaries for dinner in Dharamsala. I sit next to this man who I wrote about in middle school, and as we share delicious Tibetan dumplings called momos he thanks me for the work I did on The Book of Forgiving. Doug takes a picture of us sitting together, and later that night he texts it to me. In the photo Archbishop Tutu and I are holding hands and looking into each other\\u2019s eyes. Doug has caught us in the middle of laughing about something. I lay in bed too excited for the week ahead to sleep, and I look at myself in the picture. I look like the shiny, happy person I have always wanted to be. Only this time I\\u2019m not pretending. The joy on my face is real. The dialogues go off without a hitch. His Holiness invites us to meditate with him in his private residence. It\\u2019s an honor to be part of the entourage in his sacred space, and as I sit to his left on the floor and join him in his morning meditation in front of his personal shrine, I feel like I am levitating. Look at me now, Eckhart Tolle. As we sit, my eyes meet Doug\\u2019s. We stare at each other for a moment, and he gives me a smile. He knows how far this room in Dharamsala is from where I\\u2019ve been. I tear up and smile back. I am overcome with gratitude, for Doug, for Archbishop Tutu, for the Dalai Lama, for the strange life that has taken me from G block to this holy space. I did not hustle or cheat or defraud my way into this room\\u2014I was invited and welcomed. What if this is my merit? I roll the idea around in my head and when Archbishop Tutu leads us in prayer and offers me the Eucharist, I take it. When he bows his head to me and murmurs a blessing, I bow my head, too, and think about the times I prayed in jail. On the floor of the holding room the night of my arrest when I prayed for help, and with the chaplain when I prayed to never do drugs again and to know my path and purpose. Here, with the Eucharist melting on my tongue, my prayer is simple: thank you. I still spend the rest of the week convinced that the most compassionate man in the world doesn\\u2019t like me, because he never singles me out for attention like he does other members of the crew. Either he hates me, I decide, or maybe he is teaching me a bigger lesson. There is the old part of me that is sure that he hates me, but the new part of me, the part that grows with every book I work on and every difficult moment I face, thinks it must be a lesson. I am just one of seven billion people living their lives. Making big mistakes over and over. Growing and shrinking and growing again. In the evenings I walk around the temple grounds, monkeys chattering in the trees, and the lesson becomes clear: It\\u2019s easier for me to think the Dalai Lama doesn\\u2019t like me than to face the fact that deep down, despite where I am and who I\\u2019m with, I\\u2019m still not sure if I like myself. Spending a week listening to Archbishop Tutu and the Dalai Lama alternate between teasing each other for not acting holy enough, and then crying over the profound suffering that is the human experience, changes me. Every day I walk away with some new nugget about the way I want to live my life\\u2014in service to others, accepting that I am always a work in progress, being more compassionate and more forgiving. Living in gratitude. Every day of the dialogues seems like a horoscope\\u2014there\\u2019s something specific relating to my life that I need to hear. The two holy men see the possibility of joy in every hard moment, and I want to live like that. They listen to each other deeply, and reach out to hold the other\\u2019s hand when someone tells a difficult story from their life. His Holiness is curious about everyone filming them: the photographer\\u2019s red hair, the sound guy\\u2019s tattoos, the cameraman\\u2019s beard. Even though it\\u2019s a joke, when the Dalai Lama says he would rather go to hell than heaven because there are more people to help in hell, I start to cry. They pause midway through each morning so everyone can stop work and drink tea together. The tea isn\\u2019t great, but the communal pause feels like another profound lesson. These men, who have both carried the fate of countries on their backs, have a lightness I crave. They teach me not to take myself too seriously. When His Holiness says all people are equal, no one is higher up or better than another, I feel like he is saying this just to me. Each night, after my walk, I go to my hotel room in Dharamsala in the shadow of His Holiness\\u2019s temple, and I write down what I saw and how I felt and who I still want to become. On our last day we do a photo shoot with Archbishop Tutu and His Holiness. Miranda, the photographer, clicks away as, one by one, members of the team receive a special khata, a blessed Tibetan scarf from the Dalai Lama, and pose for pictures. When it\\u2019s my turn, I am nervous to be standing between these two men, and a bit flustered. My security badge is tangled up with my khata and both are tangled in my hair. His Holiness takes my hand, and our eyes meet. His hands are softer than any skin I have ever felt before, softer than any baby I have ever held. Then he holds his hand up to Miranda to stop the shoot. This is it, I think, this is my moment. He has seen my soul. I hold my breath to see what will happen next, and he starts fussing with my hair. Untangling the khata and the security badge and freeing my hair. Smoothing it down, putting me back together again. Miranda takes photos of it all, and I know I will look at them on the nights when the world questions my merit. When I question my merit. Standing between these two spiritual leaders, it suddenly doesn\\u2019t matter what people think of me. I am standing in the light, at a temple, in service to something bigger than my insecurities and flaws. Bigger than my past and my mistakes. Before I walk away, each man holds one of my hands and I tell them both, \\u201cThank you. You have changed my life.\\u201d When I turn to leave, His Holiness grabs my hands again and slowly bows and touches his forehead to mine. I close my eyes, and we stay that way for a few seconds, or maybe a lifetime. \\n chapter 20 MANY LIVES Doug spends the next year writing The Book of Joy based on the dialogues in Dharamsala, and I work on a relationship book about the eight conversations you should have before you marry someone. I never had any of these conversations before any of my marriages. I am also writing a book called Designing Your Life that publishes on the same day as The Book of Joy. Both books hit the New York Times bestseller list. I am ecstatic and proud, and all the hard work and sleepless nights feel worth it. Each literary accolade is like money in the bank to me. A savings account I use as leverage against other parts of my life that are not as successful. I am still on probation even though it should have ended two years ago. To get me off probation, Elizabeth and I go back to court. She argues with Probation, saying that I had gone above and beyond during my incarceration and on probation and I should be let off and allowed to pay my restitution as I can over time without the threat of going back to jail hanging over my head. She tells the judge that Designing Your Life is number one on the New York Times list. I think she is trying to show I have a valid job and also prove I\\u2019m a valuable member of society now and will not walk away from my debt. The judge does not seem that impressed. I hate sitting on the bench outside the courtroom waiting for the judge\\u2019s ruling. I feel automatically guilty. I can taste jail in my mouth\\u2014rusted metal and locked doors and the bitterness of isolation. Before I was locked up, freedom used to feel like a vague, blurry concept and a given privilege, about as easy to pin down as wind. Now I understand freedom in the way you can only understand something when it\\u2019s gone. Even out of jail, as long as I\\u2019m on probation, I\\u2019m still not free. The judge gives me the choice to either stay on probation until restitution is completely paid or make my restitution payments to a county collection agency and get off probation. The judge wants to make sure I understand that the latter option will ruin my credit. Elizabeth starts to argue, but the judge stops her. She looks at me and shrugs. There\\u2019s just no way they are going to let me off probation without some penalty hanging over me. The choice is roughly equivalent to declaring bankruptcy, and it will keep my credit rating abysmally low for seven years. Choosing between two bad choices is never easy, but I choose door number two. Bad credit seems better than living while holding your breath. Probation has turned my one-year sentence into a seven-year sentence, and now I have to add another seven years of bad credit. But I take this trade-off in order to sleep in peace. The irony is that probation was originally invented as an alternative to incarceration. In the mid-1800s a man in Boston convinced a judge to let him keep another drunken man in his care so he could rehabilitate him before sentencing. When the State of New York introduced probation in the early 1900s, one of the magistrate\\u2019s arguments for creating a probation system was that it could be \\u201cpunishment without disgrace, and effective without producing embitterment, resentment or demoralization.\\u201d Disgrace, embitterment, resentment, and demoralization is just another Monday in the modern world of probation. And if it was hard for me to navigate all the conflicting requirements and illogical bureaucracy as a white, educated woman with some social support, how difficult was it for others without the same sort of opportunities and privilege? Late at night I sometimes read through the jail arrest logs, so I know when Kiki is back in, and the same for Spider, Vivian, and Nina. The only women I don\\u2019t see rearrested are the ones who went off to prison. I send care packages to them through the commissary\\u2014chocolate bars and bear claws and ramen. I know the money should go to paying back my own restitution, but this is a different kind of restitution. These strangers saved my life and lifted me up with their friendship when I was at my lowest. I owe them. Meeting the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Tutu and all the other authors I get to interact with every day makes me feel valuable, but so did these women. The difference is, I could be honest with these women. Living a covert life, whether for good or bad, takes its toll. If I am only as sick as my secrets, well then, I am in hospice. And I have had enough. Not enough to tell my secrets, but enough that I have decided I need to move away from this place I have lived for the last twenty-five years. I\\u2019m going to work my ass off and save enough money to pay my restitution and move far away. I want to go live in Hawaii, on an island thousands of miles away from this community where I no longer belong. I tell Doug this stretch goal. \\u201cI need to save up enough money\\u2014Kaden graduates in 2023 and then when he goes off to college I\\u2019m going to move to Hawaii. I can work remotely.\\u201d \\u201cIs that what you really want to do?\\u201d \\u201cYes. I want to build a big family compound for all my boys\\u2014a place where they can come home to, a place where if they have families one day they can bring them. And when I die it will be theirs to share and create memories in. \\u201cI\\u2019m tired of running away from things,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI want to run toward something. And that something is Hawaii.\\u201d \\u201cSo, if I\\u2019m understanding you correctly, you want to run to Hawaii?\\u201d I laugh. \\u201cYes, exactly. Someday I\\u2019m going to run all the way to Hawaii.\\u201d \\u201cIf that\\u2019s what you want, then I support you in doing that, and you have job security for life. I want us to work together until we are a hundred years old. We are peanut butter and jelly. Lennon and McCartney,\\u201d he says. \\u201cRide or die,\\u201d I reply. I\\u2019m trying to make Doug more \\u201cstreet\\u201d and he flashes me a sideways peace sign in response that makes me laugh. With every new book I write I get to be a different person, live a different life. I want that same freedom in my real life. I hope I can find it in Hawaii, and I hope I can bear the weight of my secrets until I get there. \\u201cLara, will you tell Bryan about your past?\\u201d Doug asks. I choke on my scrambled eggs and take a sip of water. The number one rule of fight club is I don\\u2019t tell our authors about my past. Doug is to my right at the small table in a hotel restaurant in Montgomery, Alabama, across from the offices of the Equal Justice Initiative. Bryan Stevenson, one of the country\\u2019s leading social justice activists and lawyers, and one of the authors we represent, sits across the table, and we\\u2019re catching up and having a nice breakfast before meeting Anthony Ray Hinton for the first time. Hinton had spent thirty years on Alabama\\u2019s death row for a crime he didn\\u2019t commit. We flew to Alabama at Bryan\\u2019s request, to meet Mr. Hinton and potentially help him with his book. I want desperately to be his cowriter. I take a deep breath. Montgomery\\u2019s air is humid, thick with its history of slavery and oppression and the fight for civil rights. I wasn\\u2019t prepared to talk about my crimes, my incarceration, my shame, and my work with others in recovery and incarcerated women who are reentering society. But I understand why Doug has asked me to share my story. While almost a year in Santa Cruz County Jail doesn\\u2019t compare to thirty years on death row, I know the pain of being alone. I know the sound of a door closing that you have no power to open yourself. I know about being judged. I know Ray before I\\u2019ve even met him, and I know that of all the books I\\u2019ve worked on, this is the book I was meant to do. And Bryan knows me as a competent member of the literary agency that represents him; he doesn\\u2019t know the many lives I have led before this breakfast until I finish my story. He doesn\\u2019t judge me. He shows compassion and kindness and understanding and says how relieved he will be to have someone working with Ray who has knowledge of the criminal justice system. And when I meet Ray, we hit it off instantly. He doesn\\u2019t trust easily, but he trusts me because I have been locked up. He was innocent, and I was guilty, but we share an understanding of captivity that transcends our differences. We walk side by side behind Bryan and Doug on the sidewalks of Montgomery. \\u201cHow much time did you do?\\u201d he asks. \\u201cJust a county year,\\u201d I say, and he knows the reference. \\u201cI\\u2019m glad you understand,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI bet you didn\\u2019t think a middle-aged white woman would be helping tell your story.\\u201d Ray laughs. \\u201cNo, I can\\u2019t say that I did, but I\\u2019m glad it\\u2019s you.\\u201d My mother dies a week after I get back from Montgomery. I had moved her to Santa Cruz and taken care of her financially and physically for the past two years while an extremely aggressive form of dementia\\u2014Lewy body dementia\\u2014changed her into someone unrecognizable. My mother, once so smart and aloof and vain and sad, had become childlike. I had become her mother. And in the last weeks of her life, I had to put aside all our history and be present for her in a way she could never be present for me. Ray, whose mother died while he was on death row, comforts me long distance in my grief. When I say I don\\u2019t have the words for grief, for regret, and I worry whether I did the right thing in her last days, he tells me to write about it. \\u201cI did,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI wrote a little each night for the last week of her life.\\u201d \\u201cRead it to me,\\u201d he says. I am embarrassed to read what I have written. It\\u2019s a jumble of random thoughts and my attempt to make meaning out of something horrific. I need to work on Ray\\u2019s book proposal, but my mother\\u2019s death fills me with a feeling of loss that I can\\u2019t reconcile with our disconnected relationship. Ray insists it will help me feel better, so I read him what I have written of the past week. Ray is silent for almost a minute after I finish reading. \\u201cYou were there for her,\\u201d he finally says. \\u201cOn death row, you die alone. In prison, you die alone. In prison you can\\u2019t be with the ones you love as they are dying. You were there. You weren\\u2019t locked up. You took care of her while she passed; be grateful for that.\\u201d Ray is right. It is the first of many lessons he will teach me about gratitude and freedom. \\u201cI walk every day simply because I can,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI eat dessert first because I don\\u2019t ever want to be too full to enjoy something sweet and delicious. \\u201cI stand in the rain because you never know when you won\\u2019t be allowed to feel the rain on your skin. I don\\u2019t ever worry about the weather.\\u201d I listen to him carefully and the week after my mom dies, I write three sample chapters and his entire book proposal in a few days. Doug submits the proposal to editors, and all those interested in publishing Ray\\u2019s book meet with Doug and Ray in New York City. I stay home and anxiously wait to hear how it all turns out. Ray gets a fantastic book deal and before we start writing the book, Doug has me listen to all the meetings he recorded in New York about the book so I can hear the different editors\\u2019 ideas for the structure of the book. There are lots of great ideas, but I\\u2019m most attuned to the line Doug says to every editor in every meeting when they ask who is going to be helping Ray write the book. \\u201cDo you know how hard it is to find an MFA who has been incarcerated?\\u201d Doug asks every editor after telling them I will be the coauthor. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know that about Lara,\\u201d says one editor. \\u201cHow wonderful\\u2026\\u201d My biggest secret, my greatest shame, has become a selling point. And that changes everything. Over the next year Ray and I spend lots of time working together on The Sun Does Shine. We mix our pain together, and we pour it on the page, and we become family. He trusts me with his story, and I trust him with mine. I learn so much about hope and gratitude and faith and friendship from Ray, and I pour everything I have in me into his story. When I write about how alone he felt on death row it helps me touch how alone I felt in jail, and some days I am on my office floor crying because through Ray I am able to tap so deeply into grief and loss that I\\u2019m not sure who I am crying for or who I am crying as, but it doesn\\u2019t matter. Other days I am so full of the goodness of Ray\\u2019s soul that the writing comes quickly and lightly. This innocent man who spent thirty years on death row teaches me as much about forgiveness as Archbishop Tutu. They both suffered and they both let it ennoble them rather than embitter them. \\u201cI forgive,\\u201d Ray says, \\u201cbecause I\\u2019m not giving the State of Alabama one more second of my life.\\u201d I try to adopt this worldview and apply it to myself. Bryan and Ray know about my past, so I bravely tell another author I work with before I work with her, and she doesn\\u2019t run away from me screaming. I take these baby steps, and then I pause to see if the world will come crashing down. When it doesn\\u2019t, I take a deep breath and contemplate my next step. For my birthday, I decide to try something I\\u2019ve always wanted to do but was too terrified to try: improv. I think of myself as an introvert so being unscripted on a stage feels like a nightmare, but there\\u2019s an equal part of me that loves to entertain and make people laugh. I show up for a drop-in adult improv class on a Saturday morning. It\\u2019s an eclectic mix of ages and personality types, and as nervous and terrified as I am, it is fun. It\\u2019s been so long since I played, since I acted silly, since I lived in the moment without carefully scripting all my interactions with others. This tribe of misfits and theater geeks and artists and writers welcomes me warmly. They invite me out to lunch after class. And so every Saturday morning, I put aside work and fear and hypervigilance, and I stand on a stage saying ridiculous things and laughing for two hours. I have found my tribe, my people, and not one of them knows about my past. When improv becomes the gateway drug to a stand-up comedy class, my new tribe comes to watch me perform my routine. Alone on a small stage I say, \\u201cSo this one time when I was in prison\\u2026\\u201d and I do a routine about my felonies and how someone gets a prison nickname and how a woman made a tiny candy shiv out of a Jolly Rancher. Afterward my new friends come up to me and say, \\u201cIs that true? Were you in prison with thirty-two felonies?\\u201d Because I have learned to be in the moment from improv class, I reply immediately in the time-honored improv style. \\u201cYes, and\\u2026 it was jail, not prison.\\u201d There is silence at first, but before I can even get mortified, my new friend Eileen says, \\u201cCool.\\u201d The others follow with similar responses, and we all go to lunch where I am not the center of conversation. And my definition of freedom gets bigger. I thought what I craved was approval and praise, but it\\u2019s simpler than that. I craved acceptance. For all the different versions of me I have been, and all the many lives I have lived. I am riding the comedy wave with my tribe, and it\\u2019s such smooth sailing that when a local Rotary Club asks me to come speak to them about my work, I readily say yes. They don\\u2019t mention my past, and I am excited to talk about our literary agency and the impact our books are having in the world. Our team has grown so much that with our foreign rights coagents, staff, and the collaborative writers I have hired and trained, we number close to thirty staff now. Ty is working full time for our company as well, and Cody is creating videos for us, so my success is also their success. The work is nonstop, and I go to the office on a Saturday morning. I am getting a contract out of Doug\\u2019s inbox when I see the email. It\\u2019s from: one@victimoflaralove.com. I open the email and read: SHAME ON YOU FOR PUTTING THIS VILE PERSON IN CHARGE OF FINANCIAL THINGS. THE COURT HAD BANNED HER FROM BEING IN THAT KIND OF FUNCTION AND YOU ARE BOTH VIOLATING THAT. I WILL BE CONTACTING THE D.A. AND COURTS. The sender has included a link to the Sentinel article\\u2014I guess in case Doug didn\\u2019t know about my past. The panic attack hits me right away. I can\\u2019t control my breathing, and my office seems to have tilted. I want to run but I can\\u2019t feel my limbs. All I can think is I\\u2019m going back to jail, and so is Doug. I call him, and when he answers I am hysterical and incomprehensible. \\u201cSomeone sent you\\u2026 in your email\\u2026 trouble\\u2026 jail\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cTake a breath,\\u201d says Doug. \\u201cAre you hurt? Are the kids okay? Sam?\\u201d \\u201cYes, but someone sent an anonymous email.\\u201d \\u201cWhere are you?\\u201d asks Doug. I can\\u2019t control my crying, and I can hear the fear in his voice, but it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m listening from underwater. Everything is muffled and removed. \\u201cOf\\u2026 fff\\u2026 ice,\\u201d I stammer. \\u201cStay right there,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI\\u2019m on my way.\\u201d I sit on the couch under shelves of all the books we\\u2019ve created and realize none of it matters. None of it changes a thing. Doug charges into the office like he\\u2019s going to battle, and I start crying all over again. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry.\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing to be sorry for. You\\u2019re not going to jail. I\\u2019m not going to jail.\\u201d I hear what he\\u2019s saying, and I know he\\u2019s being logical, but all I can think of is that my worst fear has come true: My reputation has ruined his reputation. Doug, who has never broken a law in his life, done a drug, been anything but kind and good, is now being threatened with jail. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go for a walk,\\u201d he says. I blindly follow him out of the office, and we walk away from the downtown area of Santa Cruz. I don\\u2019t feel safe outside. I don\\u2019t feel safe inside. As we walk, I keep looking over my shoulder, sure that the police are going to pull up any moment and take us both away. When Doug stops in front of the bank where we do business, I follow him inside without question. If he wants to get a little banking done while I\\u2019m having a meltdown, who am I to judge? We approach Gustavo, who handles our accounts, and Doug greets him warmly. \\u201cListen,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI want to add Lara as a signer on all our business accounts.\\u201d Gustavo looks at me and I know I look like hell, but I smile weakly. This is Doug\\u2019s way of showing me how much he trusts me. \\u201cI meant to do this a long time ago,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI just never found a moment where we were both free at the same time. Today is the perfect day.\\u201d The paperwork appears in front of me and I sign. Back at the office, Doug makes sure I am okay before he leaves. \\u201cThis is nothing to be worried about,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThe person who sent that email is a coward. If someone was concerned, they could just call me.\\u201d I nod. I know he\\u2019s right, and I\\u2019m a bit embarrassed that I thought we would both go to jail. When he leaves, I call Eileen. Besides being my new best friend, she used to work for the NSA. I tell her about the email, and she goes to work trying to trace it with some computer magic. The closest she gets is an address. I look it up online, and it is a business park with multiple offices. I leave the office and drive to the address. If someone is threatening me, I want to know who it is. I slowly drive by each business in the lot. A sign shop, an accounting office, a boat supply company. I google each business trying to find out the owner\\u2019s name. Is it one of my old neighbors? I don\\u2019t recognize any of the businesses. I don\\u2019t know any of their owners or employees. I try to think about what could have triggered this email seven years into my job at Idea Architects, nine years after my arrest. And then it hits me. I agreed to give a public talk about my work as a ghostwriter. I search out the Rotary Club that invited me and see that they have just announced me as a speaker. For years I have lived under the radar, and then I forgot. The person who sent this email must be a member of the Rotary Club. I call the woman who set up the speaking event and leave her a voicemail. \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry,\\u201d I say, \\u201cbut I won\\u2019t be able to speak at your event after all. Something\\u2019s come up.\\u201d Logically I know I can\\u2019t go back to jail now that I\\u2019m off probation, but this message about my past triggers me. This hatred from the community triggers me. For every two steps forward, I take one step back. Or maybe it\\u2019s the other way around. The only difference now is I don\\u2019t have to walk alone. I have Bryan Stevenson and Ray Hinton and Eileen and Doug. I have Sam and my children. I have my comedy friends. They love me, they trust me, and I try to tell myself that it\\u2019s enough to keep me safe. \\n chapter 21 REAL POWER I\\u2019ve had lots of imaginary conversations with Oprah Winfrey. I used to watch her talk show every afternoon. I laughed when she laughed, cried when she cried, and imagined myself sitting on a couch with her. Reading was escape, and so was Oprah. Ray and I are at Book Passage in Corte Madera, California. I\\u2019ve come to see him while he is on his book tour. The moms whose game night I couldn\\u2019t join at Kate\\u2019s house before I met the Dalai Lama have now invited me to join their book club. I gave them all my advance reader copies, the early versions of the book reserved for reviewers, and they\\u2019re also in the audience here, clutching their early copies. The bookstore\\u2019s owner is distressed at seeing the review copies in their hands. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not supposed to have those,\\u201d she says to them. I step in and point to my name on the cover under Ray\\u2019s. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThose are my copies, and these folks will still buy the hardback version tonight.\\u201d Dylan and Eileen are also with me, and it feels like a great event. Ray is on fire as he shares his story, and there\\u2019s not a dry eye in the house. After the event, we only have a little time to catch up before he\\u2019s whisked off to another event in a different city. I am in the office the next day when Ray calls. \\u201cHellooooo,\\u201d I say. \\u201cThat was such a great event last\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cLara!\\u201d He\\u2019s whispering. \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d He clears his throat. \\u201cI\\u2019m hiding in the bathroom at my hotel. They are setting up for an interview outside the door so I have to be quiet.\\u201d I\\u2019m still confused. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d \\u201cNothing\\u2019s wrong. She called me, Lara.\\u201d \\u201cWho called you?\\u201d \\u201cOprah! Oprah Winfrey just called me. She told me it was Oprah, and at first I didn\\u2019t believe her.\\u201d \\u201cReally?\\u201d I ask dubiously. Ray is known for playing jokes, so I don\\u2019t know if he\\u2019s teasing or not. \\u201cShe picked the book, Lara. She picked The Sun Does Shine for her book club. I\\u2019m not supposed to tell anyone, but of course I\\u2019m calling you right away. This is our book. But you can\\u2019t tell anyone, you can\\u2019t tell anyone.\\u201d \\u201cNot even Doug?\\u201d \\u201cNot yet. She told me I can\\u2019t tell anyone.\\u201d I want to say \\u201coh my God\\u201d or \\u201choly fucking shitballs,\\u201d but Ray is a man of faith who never curses, so instead I just scream. \\u201cI\\u2019m so happy for you, Ray! So many people are going to read your story now. This is absolutely amazing!\\u201d \\u201cI have to go do this interview, but I will call you tonight.\\u201d I want to laugh and cry and scream. This is the first Oprah pick for our agency. The first book where my name appears on the cover as a coauthor. This is Ray, one of my dearest friends, and a man who has experienced more injustice than just about anyone I know. I want to dance and shout and tell everyone the news, but I can\\u2019t. I sit with the news for three hours. I can\\u2019t concentrate on work, and all I want to do is call Doug. I want to tell him as a friend. I want to tell him as his business partner. And I want to tell him because he\\u2019s Ray\\u2019s agent, and he should know. But Ray trusts me, and I gave him my word. Mostly I just want somebody to celebrate with. I am just about to give in and tell Doug when a flurry of emails come in from Ray\\u2019s editor and the publicity and marketing people at his publisher. Oprah has officially picked the book, and we all have to sign nondisclosure agreements and keep it secret for a couple of months. I call Doug immediately. \\u201cDid you see your email?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cNo, what?\\u201d \\u201cRead your email and call me back,\\u201d I say and hang up. I realize then that he might think it\\u2019s another threatening letter so I quickly text him: IT\\u2019S GOOD NEWS! He calls back within seconds and we scream into the phone. I call Ray back and tell him that Bryan, the publisher, and Doug have all been informed. When the publisher explains to us that it could be months before the official announcement because they have to order enough paper to meet the demand for books once the news is out, the significance of this news sets in. I\\u2019m invited to go to New York City with Ray for the live television announcement on CBS This Morning, hosted by Gayle King. Despite growing up in Boston, despite working in publishing, I have never been to New York before. I can\\u2019t tell anyone why I\\u2019m going so I just say it\\u2019s for work. Dylan is in New York on a business trip, so we spend two days together before he has to leave. Ray, his best friend Lester, and I are all staying at the same hotel. Doug is also joining us at CBS but is staying with his family. We all meet for breakfast before the car arrives to take us to the studio. Our editor, George Witte, meets us there and we all walk in together. The entire morning feels surreal, but it\\u2019s real. And it\\u2019s fucking fantastic. Ray is going to be live on air with Gayle King and Oprah, and I\\u2019ll be in the glass-walled greenroom on set where Lester, Doug, George, and I can all watch the action in real time. Ray is calm as can be while my heart pounds. Once we get settled, Lester and I are sitting next to each other on the couch facing the set when I look up and see Oprah looking in at us. Behind her looms an image of the book\\u2019s cover that takes up the entire wall. The title, Ray\\u2019s name, and then my name below his. Oprah gives a little wave. I wave back. I stare at her in real life and feel vindicated, because in my mind anything Oprah approves of the culture approves of. And Oprah approves of me. Ray is doing so well with his interview that they keep him on for an extra segment. He comes back to the greenroom and we hug, and I tell him he absolutely killed it. Before he can reply, Gayle and Oprah walk in. Ray introduces me to Oprah. Tells her I am his writer. \\u201cHi,\\u201d she says and gives me a big smile. \\u201cHi!\\u201d I have nothing more eloquent to say in her presence. \\u201cYou did a great job,\\u201d she says. \\u201cYou are an incredible writer.\\u201d And that\\u2019s it. I can die now. My life is complete. \\u201cDo you want to take pictures?\\u201d she asks. Gayle and Oprah, both in yellow, flank me on either side and Doug snaps away with his phone. I am smiling so huge I must look like my head will burst. It\\u2019s all a whirlwind because Gayle has to get back on the air for her next segment, and Oprah has to go be Oprah. We\\u2019re just about to leave when an assistant to Oprah comes in and invites Doug and me to lunch with Oprah and Gayle and Ray and Lester. I am about to be someone who lunches with Oprah. We have an hour to kill before lunch so the four of us wait in the lobby. I have dozens of messages and emails from people who see the show. The news is out. The restaurant we are going to clears the back half because it\\u2019s Oprah. The manager takes me through first. \\u201cIs this table okay?\\u201d he asks nervously. I look around the room not knowing exactly what I\\u2019m looking for. In jail, you never want to sit with your back to the door. Oprah is the ultimate shot caller, so I pick a table to the side, so she can see all the entrances and exits. At lunch I am seated to her left, and when the waiter comes to take our order, Oprah points to Ray and asks the waiter if he knows who he is. \\u201cNo, sorry.\\u201d \\u201cYou will,\\u201d says Oprah. \\u201cYou want to know him. And you will.\\u201d She orders champagne for the table, and we toast to Ray. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to go stand on Fifth Avenue and hand this book out to every person who walks by,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be a bestseller!\\u201d The lunch is lively, and everyone is in a great mood. Doug and Gayle and Ray and Lester are engaged in some conversation that I\\u2019m not tracking because I am sitting next to Oprah. She has been making little side comments to me on the bigger conversations all throughout lunch. I hang on every word\\u2014the ultimate fangirl. She tells me she loves the book, and that her team didn\\u2019t want her to pick it because she had just picked a book about someone incarcerated. \\u201cBut you know what I said?\\u201d she asks. \\u201cNo, what?\\u201d \\u201cI said, \\u2018Do you see your name on this company? No, you don\\u2019t. That\\u2019s my name, and this is the book we are going to do.\\u2019 And they read it, and I was right.\\u201d She leans toward me and whispers, \\u201cThat\\u2019s power, Lara, that is real power.\\u201d I recall telling Daddy that real power is quiet power. And I smile at Oprah as she toasts the table, and I think maybe real power isn\\u2019t always quiet. Maybe real power is saying things out loud and owning your own story like you own a company or a network or a magazine. Real power is putting your name on things. Real power is about using your power to shine a light on other people so they can find their own power. A crowd has begun to gather outside the restaurant. I listen as Oprah schools me about power, Doug about movie deals, and Ray about managing his money and what to do when cousins of cousins come out and want him to pay their bills because he is famous. With each person she has a way of speaking their exact language. It\\u2019s a gift. A powerful gift that gives her the kind of power Daddy couldn\\u2019t even imagine. I look around this table, this restaurant in New York City, this unlikely lunch party, and realize that I have no idea what I want to do next. Life is strange and heartbreaking and wonderful, and it can change on you in an instant. I have been so many different people in my life\\u2014wife, mother, real estate agent, Little League coach, school board member, lover, fighter, addict, felon. I have done good things, and I have done bad things. I have been so many different people in the books I\\u2019ve ghostwritten, and worn so many different hats in my job, just to keep myself busy and striving. And during all of it, there was always this desperate undercurrent of me trying to prove to the world that I\\u2019m valuable and worthy, more good than bad. I realize suddenly that I\\u2019m tired of pretending I am anything other than who I am. People may love me or hate me, praise me or criticize me, reward me or punish me. All I can be is who I am now, and then work hard to become the person I most want to be. I\\u2019m tired of hustling for an approval even the great and powerful Oprah can\\u2019t really give me. I know what I\\u2019m looking for can only be found on the inside, and it\\u2019s going to be my job to keep finding it over and over. By the time we finish lunch, The Sun Does Shine has become the number one best-selling book on Amazon. Ray and I take this in on the car ride back to the hotel, both of us sitting side by side in silence at first. \\u201cWe did it,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWe did it, Ray, we really did it.\\u201d And then we look into each other\\u2019s eyes and laugh and I start to cry. Neither of us has the words to convey how this feels. We were both somewhere else and now we\\u2019re here. Together. He leans toward me and I meet him halfway across the seat and we embrace. Ray was once a condemned man on death row, and I was once in jail with a sheet wrapped around my neck. Now we are both number one bestsellers. Twenty-four hours later I am back home, doing laundry, sweeping dog hair off the floor. Lunch with Oprah already feels far away. The entire flight home I replayed the lunch and Oprah\\u2019s words. I know I have a lot more inner work to do. I thought I had to convince the whole world that I am more than the worst thing I have done, the worst person I have been, but really I just have to convince myself. Now that I have brushed up against Oprah, old friends I haven\\u2019t spoken to since before my arrest call me and gush. People want to get together. People want to have lunch. People want to know how I am. It all feels hollow, though. I don\\u2019t want a community to welcome me just because Oprah made me valuable again in their eyes. I don\\u2019t want any friendships that are shallow or conditional. I want real relationships. Real friends. Real community. And, I realize, I don\\u2019t want to divorce Santa Cruz. I want to stay and make it work. Hawaii is a beautiful place to visit, but I don\\u2019t want to banish myself to an island. Soon after I return from New York, Sam, Chase, Kaden, and I go to Hawaii for a vacation. I didn\\u2019t want to live there anymore, but I did want to visit. We go straight to the beach from the airport, and Kaden and Chase are boogie boarding while Sam and I watch from the sand. The swell picks up out of nowhere, and suddenly the waves are huge, and the sets are relentless. Chase rides his board in, but Kaden is struggling. The waves are crashing over him and pulling him farther from shore. It is like one of my natural-disaster nightmares I\\u2019ve had since my arrest\\u2014where my boys are being pulled away from me and I can\\u2019t reach them. Only this is real. As if in slow motion, I see the lifeguard jump out of his tower and run into the ocean, with Sam running right behind him. Everyone on the beach stands up to watch. Another swimmer is trying to reach him as well. Three powerful swimmers who all know the ocean are trying to save him while I can only stand on the beach and watch. Only I can\\u2019t watch. I can\\u2019t even breathe. I turn away, turn my back on the ocean and on Kaden. I am a coward. I am weak. I am afraid. I only look away for a few seconds before I force myself to turn back and stand witness to my youngest son\\u2019s struggle to survive. Sam, the lifeguard, and the other man have hold of Kaden but they\\u2019re all fighting the waves to get to shore. At least he isn\\u2019t alone. I stand on the sand in the sun and face him and will them all to come in safely. The old me would have hid my fear from him, but when he makes it onto the beach I run to him. I wrap my arms around him and burst into tears. \\u201cAre you okay? I\\u2019m so glad you are okay. I was so scared. Oh my God.\\u201d He is shaking and he hugs me back, but then quickly lets go. \\u201cI\\u2019m fine. I\\u2019m okay.\\u201d \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t watch,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI was so scared, and I turned away because I couldn\\u2019t watch. I\\u2019m so sorry I did that.\\u201d I start to cry even harder, and as a crowd gathers around us, he gets frustrated. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d he says. \\u201cLet\\u2019s just go! God!\\u201d I\\u2019m embarrassing him even more than a public beach rescue. I quickly gather our things from the beach and we walk to our rental car. Sam opens the back for us and puts the boogie boards in, and then he and Chase get in the car. Kaden and I stand at the open trunk and I fold him in my arms again. He rests his head on my shoulder. \\u201cI love you,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI was so scared.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, baby guy. I was so scared too. I love you so much.\\u201d We hold each other like that, sandy and afraid, but together. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d I say. \\u201cYou\\u2019re okay. We\\u2019re okay.\\u201d I have been watching Kaden for signs of trauma ever since his year away from me. When he was in first grade, he told me he had a secret he couldn\\u2019t tell me and I panicked, thinking it was something horrific, some abuse from his nights in foster care before Bryan and Darcy had taken him. I begged Dylan, Cody, and Ty to try to get the information out of him and tried to steel myself for the bad news. It turned out he had kissed a girl on the cheek. Every day I inspected him for any places where I had broken him, and year after year, even though I didn\\u2019t find any outward signs, I was prepared for his trauma to manifest in some big way. Just when I start to think that we\\u2019ve escaped unscathed, almost overnight, he is hit with crippling anxiety. He suddenly thinks he is going to be kidnapped. He is afraid to be home alone, afraid to sleep without a flashlight aimed at his door, afraid even to walk downstairs and get water on his own. He stops hanging out with friends, he doesn\\u2019t go outside, and his fears overwhelm him. I immediately take him to therapy, to an anxiety coach, to EMDR treatments. I buy him herbal stress remedies. I try everything, and still he is afraid. I don\\u2019t know if it is just puberty hormones, a phase, or if it\\u2019s the beginning of mental health issues he will struggle with for a lifetime. This anxiety is real and tangible and stronger than something that can just be cured through a mother\\u2019s love and attention. It\\u2019s something unseen and unknown, and nothing I try seems to help. I feel guilty and powerless. I want him to feel safe, and no matter what I say or do, he simply doesn\\u2019t. We talk about his anxiety often, and he keeps telling me we need to move. We\\u2019re still renting the only home that hadn\\u2019t required a background check when we left Doug\\u2019s house, and finding another such rental seems impossible. But Kaden is insistent. He starts to email me real estate listings. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t buy a house,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWhy not?\\u201d \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have the money you need to put down on a house. Homes are so expensive here, it\\u2019s impossible.\\u201d When I tell Doug about Kaden\\u2019s anxiety and his wanting to move, Doug is sympathetic. \\u201cMaybe you should listen to him.\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t afford to buy a house. I have nowhere near the kind of down payment money I would need.\\u201d \\u201cYou could borrow the money against your profit share in the business.\\u201d \\u201cSeriously?\\u201d \\u201cSeriously.\\u201d Sam and I make a list of everything we want in our dream house. Bedrooms for the kids, an office for me, outdoor space for the dogs, a workshop for Sam. We describe this imaginary place to each other and ask Kaden, Chase, and Dahlia what they imagine in their dream home. A week later a friend of a friend tells me about the house she is selling. It is on seven acres and has everything on our list. This is right before Halloween, and by Thanksgiving we are set to close escrow. I have never owned a home, and when Sam and I go to sign the paperwork, I realize that this thirty-year mortgage isn\\u2019t just a whole new level of financial commitment, it\\u2019s also me committing to being a stable, income-earning, non-drug-using, stay-out-of-jail, gainfully employed type of person for the next thirty years. I\\u2019m going to be someone\\u2019s permanent neighbor. This is going to be my permanent home. It feels so much bigger than just a new house\\u2014there\\u2019s a weight to it that I take on. A week after we move in, I can\\u2019t find Kaden anywhere in the house and I panic. \\u201cSam, Kaden\\u2019s gone!\\u201d \\u201cHe went for a walk with the dogs.\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d I am incredulous. \\u201cI mean, he\\u2019s walking. Outside. With the dogs.\\u201d After nine months of his not being able to go downstairs alone, I can\\u2019t believe it. I am waiting for him when he gets back. \\u201cHow was your walk?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cAwesome.\\u201d \\u201cHow did you sleep last night?\\u201d \\u201cGreat!\\u201d \\u201cHow\\u2019s the anxiety, then?\\u201d I sound anxious when I ask this, so I say it again more nonchalantly, and he laughs. \\u201cI told you we just needed to move. I\\u2019m fine. Stop freaking out all the time. Jeez.\\u201d It is such a normal fourteen-year-old thing to say that I laugh, and when he rolls his eyes I laugh harder. At Christmastime all the boys and their friends converge on the new house. We are sitting around the dining room table laughing and I think about being in G and imagining a home with sunlight and happy faces. It\\u2019s taken a decade but this, I realize, is that home. And it didn\\u2019t just help Kaden\\u2019s anxiety\\u2014it helped heal mine as well. As long as I keep showing up every day in my life, no one can take this home away from me. There is no other shoe that is going to drop. I have all my boys with me, and this home is all I have ever wanted\\u2014safety, sanctuary, and joy. All I\\u2019ve ever really wanted is a place to call home, and now I have it. Kaden and I are both growing up. And for the first time, I really believe we are each going to be okay. \\n chapter 22 THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER DONE I\\u2019ve obviously lost my mind. It was easy when I was high on Oprah and New York City to decide to own my story and stop caring what other people think, but it\\u2019s another thing to step out on a stage and actually rat myself out. Plus, I\\u2019ve had no time to prepare. We\\u2019ve had an author in town all week, so I\\u2019ve had no time to rehearse or memorize what I\\u2019m going to say or how I\\u2019m going to say it. The theme of this TEDx is hope. I hope I don\\u2019t throw up. I was also hoping Doug would talk me out of it at the last second. \\u201cA lot of our authors still don\\u2019t know my past. People might be upset.\\u201d \\u201cLara, I will say what I\\u2019ve always said. If people don\\u2019t want to work with us because of your past, we don\\u2019t want to work with those people.\\u201d \\u201cI know, but\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cLook, if you\\u2019re not ready, you can back out. A bad TED Talk is worse than no TED Talk.\\u201d This gets my competitive edge up, as he knows it will. \\u201cI can do it,\\u201d I say. \\u201cI just need a couple of hours to practice what I want to say so I don\\u2019t embarrass myself while I\\u2019m humiliating myself.\\u201d Doug laughs. A year earlier I had gone to see a shaman and she told me she needed to do a soul retrieval. \\u201cWhat does that mean?\\u201d I asked. \\u201cSometimes a part of our soul fractures off. It can happen in early childhood or during trauma. I can go in and retrieve it.\\u201d I still didn\\u2019t completely understand, but if I had left pieces of my soul lying around I wanted to pick them up. I was ready to be whole. During the ceremony or procedure or whatever it was that had me lying on a table while she shook rattles over me, she told me that before I was born into this life, my soul made a contract. \\u201cWhat was the contract?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure exactly what this means, but maybe it will resonate with you.\\u201d \\u201cOkay,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWhat contract did I make?\\u201d She looks at me and gives a little shrug. \\u201cYour contract was to be on a stage as no one.\\u201d \\u201cWhat does that mean? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?\\u201d \\u201cYour contract is what you agree you\\u2019re here in this lifetime to learn\\u2014it\\u2019s always something hard.\\u201d \\u201cWell, can I break it?\\u201d \\u201cOnce you\\u2019ve learned what you\\u2019ve needed to learn, you don\\u2019t need to break it. You\\u2019ve fulfilled the obligations of that contract. It can end.\\u201d I think about the secrets I had been keeping, my ghostwriting, my addiction, my lying, my loneliness\\u2014all the things that had kept me feeling removed from myself, from life. I was done being on a stage as no one, I was done living in shame, and I was done living under the shadow of the worst person I had been. I was ready to be on a stage as me. So for almost fourteen minutes I stand on a stage and tell everyone who wanted to listen exactly what I was so afraid they would find out. I was once the neighbor from hell. And then I tell them about some other people I have been. I ask everyone in the audience to think about the worst thing they had ever done, and then I ask them to tell it to the person to their right. The audience gasps, and that feeling behind the gasp is exactly what shame feels like. I am done living in shame. I talk about how high the barriers are to rejoining society after incarceration, and how much harder it becomes under the weight of gossip and judgment. I am telling myself what I most need to hear. That I\\u2019m human, and humans make mistakes. I no longer live in fear of the \\u201cNeighbor from Hell\\u201d headline. I own it and say yes, that\\u2019s who I was for a moment, for a season of my life, but it\\u2019s not who I have always been nor who I have become. That headline has no power over me anymore. It won\\u2019t shut me up or shut me down. For the first time in over a decade, I google myself. The headline doesn\\u2019t immediately pop up. It\\u2019s still there. It will always be there. But now you have to click through a few pages in the search results, and this feels right. For the first time since my arrest, I drive past my old house. Around the cul-de-sac where neighbors and friends stood gawking as I was taken away in handcuffs. My former front yard is full of plastic toddler toys. The fence DJ and I built is sagging, but it still stands. As I drive through my old neighborhood, I wait for my heart to race and my chest to constrict. I\\u2019m on the lookout for an angry mob. I watch for the shame and fear to flood my body. They don\\u2019t. In the end, it\\u2019s just another house in another neighborhood. And behind every front door is a family made up of people with their own struggles, their own secrets, and their own fear and shame that someday those secrets will be found out. So yes, I was once the neighbor from hell. I have also been a dozen different people in a dozen different books. I have lived many lives and will hopefully live many more. But for now I am just myself. I have done lots of good in my life, and I have also done lots of bad. One doesn\\u2019t negate the other. And the truth is, I don\\u2019t believe the worst thing I have ever done is found in the stealing or lying or drug abuse. The worst thing I\\u2019ve ever done is build an identity out of the worst thing I\\u2019ve ever done. I\\u2019ve condemned others for not being able to see beyond my past when I was the one who couldn\\u2019t see beyond my past. There\\u2019s no doubt that our \\u201cjustice\\u201d system is broken. There\\u2019s no doubt that as a society we ask people to pay far beyond what their criminal sentences ask of them. It\\u2019s a truth we all need to examine. Because how we take care of broken people matters. Fundamentally, I believe, it determines our own humanity. And we don\\u2019t just sentence someone to a year or five years or ten years\\u2014we turn every sentence into a life sentence. Every sentence is a life sentence. I believe the best thing that ever happened to me was going to jail. I am a better mother, a better friend, a better worker, and a better writer because of my experiences. I\\u2019ve been a liar and a truth-teller, selfish and selfless. I\\u2019ve been smart and stupid. I have hated myself and learned to love myself. I have hustled for my self-worth\\u2014looking for it in the things I owned, in other people\\u2019s love and approval\\u2014but I have come to accept it as fundamental regardless of what I do or don\\u2019t do. There is freedom in owning all the parts of me\\u2014the good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful. I made the conscious choice to create an identity out of the worst things ever said about me, and now I choose differently. It was always my choice. I eventually become co-CEO of Idea Architects, but then in 2022 I leave to start my own literary agency. I name it True Literary because I want to create something wholly true to me, to my vision for books and stories that will make the world a better and kinder place for everyone. It sounds a little cheesy, but I think, as the Dalai Lama would say, it\\u2019s my dharma\\u2014that I\\u2019m finally living my soul\\u2019s purpose. I think often about what Oprah told me about real power\\u2014and my takeaway was that it\\u2019s not only having your name on the door but using your power to shine a light on other people. I will always have a soft spot for the underdog, the ones living at the margins of life, the addicts, the criminals, and anyone who wants to transform their suffering by using their own stories to inspire others. I\\u2019m grateful for all the people who lifted me up while I was at my lowest, and I try to pay it forward wherever and whenever I can. My older boys are all grown and out of college. Kaden will be graduating and heading off to college soon, and his memories of being taken from home have faded. I no longer overcompensate for what happened, and he no longer tests me to make sure I will stay. The single year we were apart no longer defines our relationship or haunts my sleep. DJ eventually found his way out of drugs. He is an ultra-endurance runner and a good father. Sam and I have been married for close to a decade, and each year that passes I settle more and more into the unfamiliar space of being vulnerable. Talking to him after a hard day, asking for help with a problem I\\u2019m struggling with, working through a disagreement\\u2014all of it still feels like learning a foreign language, but with practice it gets easier. I guess the third time really is the charm. My home is chaotic and loud and full of children and animals and love. My addiction to escape is in remission, but I stay vigilant in case it shows up again. For now, there is no other place I\\u2019d rather be than where I am. There is no other person I\\u2019d rather be than who I am. And no other life I\\u2019d rather live than the beautiful mess of a life I\\u2019m living. \\n acknowledgments Buckle up because this is going to be a lot. For as much as I like to think of myself as a loner, there are so many people from my many lives who I need to acknowledge. First, I have to thank my agent, my friend, my partner in crime (not literally, people), my first champion, and the person who opened up a brave new world of wonder and opportunity and words to me when I was at my lowest\\u2014Doug Abrams. If \\u201cthank you\\u201d is the most powerful prayer there is, then I offer it up to you, Doug. Thank you, a million times thank you! Peanut Butter Meet Jelly. I also must thank my other agent, my more fashionable and chic twin, my work bestie, my Wordle foe, and one of the most brilliant and badass women I know in business and in life\\u2014Rachel Neumann. I want to be you when I grow up. Thank you for supporting me through this process, even when I was crying in parking lots, and for the many times you were just simply there\\u2014a calm presence when I was anything but. Doug and Rachel make everyone they meet better humans. You should meet them!

I love you all fiercely. Finally, to Sam, my third-time\\u2019s-a-charm husband who shows me every day just how magical and exhilarating steady love and support can be. You make me feel safe. You make me feel loved. You adore me at my quirkiest, and support every single crazy idea I\\u2019ve ever had. You have no idea what a gift you are just by being next to me. I can\\u2019t believe I\\u2019ve made it married so long, and I can\\u2019t wait to see what the next thirty-plus years have in store for us!

However, he actually laid an implied premise for his argument, which one of the followings is true?", "choice_A": "Each must read for himself or herself and testify anew.", "choice_B": "Readers must reach a high standrad to some degree.", "choice_C": "It is the readers' obligation to get the \"truth\" from the primary narrator.", "choice_D": "The performative interpretation of language transforms what it interprets.", "answer": "B", "context": "Chapter Five\nJOSEPH CONRAD:\nSHOULD WE READ\nHEART OF DARKNESS}\nThe inaccessible incites from its place of hiding.\n\n\nSHOULD WE READ Heart of Darkness} May we read it? Must we read it?\nOr, on the contrary, ought we not to read it or allow our students and the\npublic in general to read it? Should every copy be taken from all the\nshelves and burned? What or who gives us the authority to make a deci-\nsion about that? Who is this \"we\" in whose name I speak? What commu-\nnity forms that \"we\" ? Nothing could be more problematic than the bland\nappeal to some homogeneous authoritative body, say professors of En-\nglish literature everywhere, capable of deciding collectively whether \"we\"\nshould read Heart of Darkness. By \"read\" I mean not just run the words\npassively through the mind's ear, but perform a reading in the strong\nsense, an active responsible response that renders justice to a book by\ngenerating more language in its turn, the language of attestation, even\nthough that language may remain silent or implicit. Such a response testi-\nfies that the one who responds has been changed by the reading. Part of\nthe problem, as you can see, is that it is impossible to decide authorita-\ntively whether or not we should read Heart of Darkness without reading\nit in that strong sense. By then it is too late. I have already read it, been\naffected by it, and passed my judgment, perhaps recorded that judgment\nfor others to read. Which of us, however, would or should want to take\nsomeone else's word for what is in a book? Each must read again in his\nor her turn and bear witness to that reading in his or her turn. In that\naphorism about which Jacques Derrida has had so much to say, Paul\nCelan says, \"Niemand / zeugt fur den / Zeugen (Nobody / bears witness\nfor the / witness).\"1 This might be altered to say, \"No one can do your\nreading for you.\" Each must read for himself or herself and testify anew.\nThis structure is inscribed in Heart of Darkness itself. The primary\nnarrator bears witness through exact citation to what he heard Marlow\nsay one night on the deck of the cruising yawl Nellie, as he and the other\nmen, the Lawyer, the Accountant, the Director of Companies, representa-\nMiller, Joseph Hillis. \"Chapter Five. Joseph Conrad: Should We Read Heart \nof Darkness?\" In Others, 104-136. Princeton: Princeton University Press, \n2002.\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n105\ntives of advanced capitalism and imperialism, waited for the tide to turn\nso they could float down the Thames and out to sea, presumably on a\npleasure cruise.2 They have enough wealth and leisure to take time off to\ndo as an aesthetic end in itself what Marlow has done for pay as a profes-\nsional seaman. The profession of the primary, framing narrator is never\nspecified. He cites with what the reader is led to believe is conscientious\nand meticulous accuracy just what Marlow said. What Marlow said, put\nwithin quotation marks throughout, is a story, the recounting of and ac-\ncounting for what he calls an \"experience\" that \"seemed somehow to\nthrow a kind of light on everything about me\u2014and into my thoughts. It\nwas sombre enough too\u2014and pitiful\u2014not extraordinary in any way\u2014\nnot very clear either. No, not very clear, and yet it seemed to throw a kind\nof light.\"3 That recounting and accounting centers on an attempt to \"ren-\nder justice,\" as Marlow puts it (94), to Kurtz, the man he meets at \"the\nfarthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience\"\n(22). What Marlow says at the beginning is also an implicit promise to his\nlisteners and to us as readers. He promises that he will pass on to them\nand to us the illumination he has received.\nThe observant reader will note that the language Conrad gives Marlow\nmixes constative and performative dimensions. On the one hand, Mar-\nlow's experience shed a kind of light on everything. It made him \"see\" in\nthe double meaning Conrad habitually gives to \"see,\" as does everyday\nlanguage: see as visual seeing and see as understanding, acquiring new\nknowledge. On the other hand, Marlow's experience conferred an obliga-\ntion that can only be fulfilled by performative language, by \"rendering\njustice\" (94) or \"remaining loyal\" (88). The performative and constative\ndimensions of any \"accounting\" or \"recounting\" are, necessarily, inter-\ntwined, as they are in any speech act. Heart of Darkness, however, is\nunusually explicit in its emphasis on the performative side of Marlow's\nlanguage, the way it is a specific kind of speech act, namely, an attesta-\ntion. \"I have remained loyal to Kurtz,\" says Marlow, \"to the last, and\neven beyond\" (88). \"I did not betray Mr. Kurtz\u2014it was ordered I should\nnever betray him\u2014it was written I should be loyal to the nightmare of my\nchoice\" (81). Who did the \"ordering\" or the \"writing\" here is not said\nexplicitly. Presumably Marlow means it was written down in the book of\nhis Fate, a sufficiently vague notion. It was because it was to be. Actually\nit was written down in the book Conrad made up about Marlow, as the\nreader may happen to reflect. Or rather, as Marlow confesses in his ac-\ncount of the last episode, his visit to Kurtz's \"Intended\" (after Kurtz has\ndied on the journey back down the African river and Marlow has re-\nturned to the city that \"always makes [him] think of a whited sepulcre\"\n[24]), he has by telling his lie to the Intended failed to render full justice\nto Kurtz: \"It seemed to me that the house would collapse before I could\n\n\n106 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nescape, that the heavens would fall upon my head. But nothing happened.\nThe heavens do not fall for such a trifle. Would they have fallen, I won-\nder, if I had rendered Kurtz that justice which was his due? Hadn't he said\nhe wanted only justice?\" (94). Kurtz had indeed said to Marlow just that:\n\"I want no more than justice\" (91).\nEarlier Marlow had said, \"I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie\"\n(64). Mariow's lie was to tell the Intended, with her soul as pure as a cliff\nof crystal, with her candid brow, that Kurtz's last words were her name,\nwhereas his actual last words were, in \"a cry that was no more than a\nbreath,\" \"The horror! The horror!\" (86). Is Marlow's lie justified? Can\nwe exonerate Marlow for it? Was this lie in any sense a way of rendering\nKurtz justice? Marlow has told us he abhors lies, that they have a taint of\nmortality about them: \"You know I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie,\" he\nsays, \"not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because\nit appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavor of mortality in lies\u2014which\nis exactly what I hate and detest in the world\u2014what I want to forget. It\nmakes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do\"\n(42). To say a lie has a taint of death is odd. It suggests that only by telling\nthe truth can we hold off death, though Marlow says just the reverse\nconcerning his lie. It has laid the ghost of Kurtz's gifts, the greatest of\nwhich was the gift of speech, \"the gift of expression, the bewildering, the\nilluminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the pulsating\nstream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable\ndarkness\" (63).\nA lie puts us in complicity with death, at the mercy of death. A lie lets\ndeath into the human community. This is a somewhat hyperbolic version\nof the repudiation of the right to lie in Immanuel Kant's opuscule, \"On\nthe Presumed Right to Lie Out of Love for Humanity.\" A lie is never jus-\ntified, says Kant, even to save someone's life, since any lie radically threat-\nens human society. The latter depends on strict truth-telling in every cir-\ncumstance, even the most extreme. \"Truth\" is a key word, though an\nexceedingly ambiguous one, in Marlow's narration in Heart of Darkness.\nHis whole story is put under the aegis of giving a true account of his\nexperience. That obligation is passed on to the primary narrator and then\non to you and me as readers. The promise to give faithful testimony is,\nlike promises in general, always messianic. It has to do with death and the\nlast days, with the sort of promise an Apocalypse makes. Even so routine\na promise as the one made by the signatory of a mortgage note invokes\ndeath, as the etymology of \"mortgage\" indicates. To sign a mortgage note\nis to engage one's life unto death, to put one's death on the line. The great\nexemplary apocalypse in our tradition, the last book of the Christian\nBible, Revelations, ends with the promise and invocation of an imminent\nunveiling that always remains future, never quite yet here and now: \"He\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n107\nwhich testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so,\ncome, Lord Jesus\" (Rev. 22:20).\nMarlow is in the position of someone who survives the death of an-\nother. In Kurtz's end, death and the consequent responsibilities of the\nsurvivor enter as central issues in the novel. As Marlow says, \"I was to\nhave the care of his memory\" (66), just as the Intended's first words to\nMarlow about Kurtz are \"I have survived\" (91). Surely the first obliga-\ntion of the survivor is to tell the truth about the dead. What is peculiar\nabout Marlow's survival of Kurtz is that Kurtz is presented when Marlow\nfinally encounters him as already the survivor of his own death. Kurtz is\nalready the ghost of himself. In that sense he cannot die. This is testified\nto in the way he survives in Marlow's narration and in the way the dusk\nstill whispers his last words when Marlow returns to Europe and visits\nKurtz's \"Intended.\" It is hardly the case that Marlow has laid the ghost of\nKurtz's gifts with a lie, since the ghost still walks, even in the room where\nMarlow tells his lie to the Intended. That ghost, far from being laid, is\nresurrected, invoked, conjured up, each time Heart of Darkness is read.\nPerhaps Marlow means no more than that he appeased the Intended's\ndesire to keep Kurtz's eloquence alive by lying about what that eloquence\nreally said and what its source was. It is not Kurtz the spectral survivor\nand revenant who is buried when Kurtz \"dies,\" but his mere bodily en-\nvelope or cadaver: \"But I am of course aware that next day the pilgrims\nburied something in a muddy hole\" (87). The chain of obligation begins\nwith Kurtz, who has passed judgment in those words \"The horror! The\nhorror!\" He \"had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his\nsoul on this earth. . . . He had summed up\u2014he had judged. 'The horror!'\nHe was a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort\nof belief; it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of\nrevolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth\u2014the\nstrange commingling of desire and hate\" (87). The chain then goes to\nMarlow, who testifies as survivor for Kurtz, keeping Kurtz alive in his\nnarration, and telling to his auditors on the Nellie the truth he had with-\nheld from the Intended. The primary narrator in his turns bears witness\nto what Marlow said by citing it exactly and by placing it in an exegetical\ncontext that is implicitly a reading.\nExact citation, prior to any interpretation, is one of the most important\nways to testify or to render justice, as in my citations from Conrad's\nHeart of Darkness here. Each quotation is accompanied by an implicit\noath: \"I swear to you this is what Conrad really wrote, or at least what\nConrad's most authoritative editors attest he wrote.\"4 The obligation to\nrender justice is then passed from Conrad's primary narrator to any\nreader, each one of whom nowadays is Conrad's survivor. From each\nreader it is demanded once again to do justice to Conrad and to Heart of\n\n\n108 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nDarkness, to attest to what happens when the book is read\u2014telling the\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\nBearing witness in an interpretation or reading, for example of Heart\nof Darkness, is a performative speech act, but of a peculiar and even\nanomalous kind. This kind is not accounted for by J. L. Austin's speech\nact theory in How to Do Things with Words.5 A performative interpreta-\ntion transforms what it interprets. It therefore cannot be fully justified by\nconstative, verifiable evidence, any more than can acts of bearing witness\nin general. No one bears witness for the witness. That the witness saw\nwhat he or she says he or she saw, or that he or she responded in a certain\nway in an act of reading, has to be taken on faith. That is why, in murder\ncases in the United States for example, the jury is asked to decide not\nwhether the defendant is guilty but whether they believe \"beyond a rea-\nsonable doubt\" that the defendant is guilty. As Jacques Derrida and Wer-\nner Hamacher have in different ways affirmed, interpretation in this per-\nformative sense, an interpretation that is inaugural, that intervenes to\nchange what is read and to initiate something new, fulfills in a paradoxi-\ncal way the eleventh of Marx's Theses on Feuerbach: \"The philosophers\nhave only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to\nchange it.\"6 In this case, the interpretation does the changing. It changes\nthe world, in however small a way, by changing once and for all an ele-\nment of that world that has power to make things happen, in this case a\nliterary text, Heart of Darkness.\nNor have Conrad's readers failed to respond to this demand for inter-\npretation. A large secondary literature has sprung up around Heart of\nDarkness. These essays and books of course have a constative dimension.\nThey often provide precious information about Conrad's life, about his\nexperiences in Africa, about late nineteenth-century imperialism, espe-\ncially about that terrible murderous devastation wrought by King Leo-\npold of Belgium in the Belgian Congo, as it was then called, about the\nsupposed \"originals\" of characters in Heart of Darkness, and so on. This\nsecondary literature, however, often also has an explicit performative di-\nmension. Conrad's novel is brought before the bar of justice, arraigned,\ntried, and judged. The critic acts as witness of his or her reading, also as\ninterrogator, prosecuting attorney, jury, and presiding judge. The critic\npasses judgment and renders justice.\nHeart of Darkness has often received a heavy sentence from its critics.\nIt has been condemned, often in angry terms, as racist or sexist, some-\ntimes as both in the same essay. Examples are the influential essay of 1975\nby the distinguished Nigerian novelist, Chinua Achebe (\"Conrad was a\nbloody racist\"), or an essay of 1989 by Bette London: \"Dependent upon\nunexamined assumptions, themselves culturally suspect, the novel, in its\nrepresentations of sex and gender, supports dubious cultural claims; it\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n109\nparticipates in and promotes a racial as well as gender ideology that the\nnarrative represents as transparent and 'self-evident.'\"7 Edward Said's\njudgment in Culture and Imperialism, though giving Conrad his due as a\ncritic of imperialism and recognizing the complexity of doing justice to\nHeart of Darkness, is in the end equally severe in his summing up: \"The\ncultural and ideological evidence that Conrad was wrong in his Eurocen-\ntric way is both impressive and rich.\"8 These are powerful indictments. If\nwhat they say renders justice to Heart of Darkness, if their witness may be\ntrusted, it might seem inevitably to follow that the novel should not be\nread, taught, or written about, except perhaps as an example of some-\nthing detestable. Nevertheless, according to the paradox I have already\nmentioned, you could only be sure about this by reading the novel your-\nself, thereby putting yourself, if these critics are right, in danger of becom-\ning sexist, racist, and Eurocentric yourself. Even so, no one bears witness\nfor the witness, and no one else can do your reading for you.\nTo pass judgment anew, it is necessary to take the risk and read Heart\nof Darkness for yourself. I shall now try to do that. First, however, I must\nask a final question. Suppose I or any other reader or community of read-\ners were to decide that Conrad, or rather Heart of Darkness, is indeed\nracist and sexist. Would it be possible, after passing that verdict, to par-\ndon Conrad or the novel he wrote, to exonerate Heart of Darkness in\nsome way, and get him set free, so to speak? To put this another way,\nwould truth in this case lead to reconciliation? To be reconciled is to be\nable to say, as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa\nhas hoped would happen, \"I forgive you. I am reconciled with you,\nthough I now know you tortured and murdered my father or mother,\nhusband or wife, brother or sister, or my neighbor, my friend.\" Though\nthe slaves were emancipated in the United States 130 years ago and\nwomen given the vote 80 years ago, the United States is still in many ways\na racist and sexist country. The sins of the fathers are visited on the chil-\ndren even unto the third generation. One might add that those sins are\nvisited also on the children and the children's children of those whom the\nfathers have wronged. The United States, like all of Africa in different\nways, will take many more generations to become reconciled to its his-\ntory, to reach anything like the horizon of a more perfect democracy. This\nis that democracy that is always, as Jacques Derrida says, \"to come.\"\nThomas Mann, in \"Death in Venice,\" cites a French proverb, \"Tout com-\nprendre c'est tout pardonner. [To understand everything is to forgive\neverything.]\"9 \"Death in Venice\" powerfully ironizes or puts in question\nthat cheerful enlightenment confidence in the exonerating power of com-\nprehension. It may be that the more knowledge we have the less able we\nare to pardon, or that pardoning, a speech act of the most exemplary and\nsovereign kind, has to occur, if it occurs, in the teeth of knowledge. On\n\n\n110 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nthe one hand, to understand everything is, it may be, to find it almost\nimpossible to forgive. Certainly that is the case with the critics I have\nmentioned. On the other hand, perhaps a true pardon is only of the unfor-\ngivable, as Derrida has been arguing in his recent seminars on \"Pardon\nand Perjury.\" If it is forgivable it does not need forgiveness. Only the\nunforgivable requires forgiveness.\nThe question of forgiveness is inscribed within Heart of Darkness in\nthe way Marlow's narrative is an implicit appeal to his listeners on the\nNellie, and indirectly also to us as readers, to forgive him for his choice of\nnightmares, for his loyalty to Kurtz. We are also asked, paradoxically, to\nforgive him for his perjury, for the lie he tells the Intended, an act of\ndisloyalty to Kurtz. Marlow's narrative is a species of confession. A con-\nfession is always a demand or prayer for forgiveness. It often reveals more\nthat needs forgiveness than the confessor knows. In this case that might\nbe the presumed racism and sexism of which Marlow (or Conrad) seems\nunaware. In his confession Marlow makes up for his lie by telling the\ntruth, unless, in a \nfinal \nirony, \"The horror!\" and the Intended's name (just\nwhat that is the reader never learns) come to the same thing, so that Mar-\nlow uttered the truth after all, even the first time. That, however, it might\nbe argued, is no excuse, even if for those in the know. Marlow, it could be\nsaid, tells the truth obliquely, but the result of his lie is that the Intended\nlives out the rest of her life within the shadowy confines of an illusion,\nthat is, within a \"horror\" that she does not even know is a horror. Mar-\nlow's lie, \"white lie\" though it is, is performatively effective because it is\nbelieved. Kant would have condemned it for unraveling the social fabric.\nNothing is said about the response of those on board the Nellie to\nMarlow's story. We do not know whether or not they forgive him his lie.\nThe Director of Companies, after Marlow \nfinishes \nhis story, says no more\nthan \"We have lost the first of the ebb\" (95), meaning that Marlow's\nstory has kept them from leaving when they ought. The primary narrator\nends his account by making an observation that might seem to be evi-\ndence of the effect of Marlow's story on his way of seeing: \"the tranquil\nwaterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under\nan overcast sky\u2014seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness\"\n(95). Any further or more explicit passing of judgment is left to the\nreader. It is up to us\u2014or rather up to me, since reading and bearing wit-\nness to what happens in reading are always solitary, lonely acts. This is\nthe case however much such judgments may be performed within the\ncoercive and determining context of codes, conventions, and protocols of\nreading. Historically and geographically determined ideologies also\nspeak through the solitary reader when he or she sums up and passes\njudgment, as Kurtz did when he said \"The horror! The horror!\" or as\nMarlow did when he said of Kurtz, \"He had summed up\u2014he had judged.\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n111\n'The horror!' He was a remarkable man\" (87), or as Achebe did when he\nsaid \"Conrad was a bloody racist.\" Nevertheless, each person who passes\njudgment must take personal responsibility for doing so. He or she must\nalso take responsibility for whatever further consequences that act of\nreading may have.\nThe first thing to say in passing judgment on Heart of Darkness is that it\nis a literary work, not history, not a travel book, a memoir, an autobiog-\nraphy, or any other genre but some form of literature. It is a literary work,\nmoreover, belonging to a particular historical time and place. It is, that is,\na work of English literature written at the moment of high capitalism and\nimperialism. This may seem obvious enough, but much criticism forgets\nthis fact or elides it. An example is what the editor of the Norton Critical\nEdition, Robert Kimbrough, says about the \"Backgrounds and Sources\"\nsection of the volume. The first part of this, says Kimbrough, \"sets the\nstory within its historical context.\" The second \"offers all that Conrad\never biographically recorded concerning his Congo experience, the artis-\ntic projection of which is Heart of Darkness.\" The third \"reminds us that,\nautobiographical though it may be, the story was to Conrad a significant,\nbut objective work of art\" (N, 84). Kimbrough, the reader can see, wants\nto have it several ways at once. Heart of Darkness is an objective work of\nart (whatever that means), but it is at the same time embedded in a histor-\nical context, the \"projection\" (whatever that means) of Conrad's \"bio-\ngraphical\" experience, and it is, after all, \"autobiographical.\" These\n\"backgrounds and sources\" invite the reader to measure the novel by its\nreferential accuracy. It is an almost irresistible temptation to do so, espe-\ncially once you know these background \"facts.\" An example of such\nyielding is talking about the place where the main events occur as the\nCongo or about the sepulchral city where Marlow gets his job as Brussels,\nwhereas neither the Congo nor Brussels is anywhere named as such in the\nnovel, while the Thames is named in the third sentence. At the very least\nsuch reticence needs to be recognized as a symptom. More radically, it is\na signal that the only way to enter the countries where the events of Heart\nof Darkness occur is by reading the novel, not by visiting Belgium or what\nis now again called the Congo.\nConrad fought a lifelong battle in his letters, prefaces, essays, and\novertly autobiographical writing, such as The Mirror of the Sea (1906), A\nPersonal Record (1912), and Notes on Life and Letters (1921), to get\nhis readers and critics to accept that his work is literature, not thinly\ndisguised autobiography or travel literature. I give two examples out of a\nlarge number. Arthur Symons, in Notes on Joseph Conrad: With Some\nUnpublished Letters (1925), cites a letter to him from Conrad in which\nthe latter rejects Symons's identification of Conrad with his fictive\n\n\n112 \nCHAPTER FIVE\ncharacter, Kurtz: \"For the rest I may say that there are certain passages in\nyour article which have surprised me. I did not know that I had 'a heart\nof darkness' and 'an unlawful soul.' Mr. Kurtz had\u2014and I have not\ntreated him with easy nonchalance\" (N, 153). A letter of July 14, 1923,\nto Richard Curie, responding to Curie's Times Literary Supplement re-\nview of the recently published Dent Uniform Edition of Conrad's works,\ncomplains bitterly of the way Curie has perpetuated the falsehood that\nhe, Conrad, is no more than a writer of sea stories. \"I was in hopes,\"\nwrites Conrad,\nthat on a general survey it could also be made an opportunity for me to get\nfreed from that infernal tale of ships, and that obsession of my sea life which\nhas about as much bearing on my literary existence, on my quality as a\nwriter, as the enumeration of the drawing-rooms which Thackeray fre-\nquented could have had on his gift as a great novelist. After all, I may have\nbeen a seaman, but I am a writer of prose. Indeed the nature of my writing\nruns the risk of being obscured by the nature of my material. . . . That the\nconnection of my ships with my writings stands, with my concurrence I\nadmit, recorded in your book is, of course, a fact. But that was a biographi-\ncal matter, not literary. (N, 152)\nWhat is the difference between biography and literature? Conrad goes\non in his letter to Curie to specify the difference in a striking figure. Al-\nmost all his \"art,\" says Conrad, consists \"in my unconventional grouping\nand perspective\" (N, 153). Artistic grouping of what? Of the apparently\nreferential or historical material of the story that is placed within the\ngrouping and lighting. This material is necessary to the illuminating\ngrouping and to its artistic effect in the same way that invisible radio\nwaves require sending and receiving apparatuses to be detected, even\nthough what is important is the invisible waves, not the apparatus: \"Of\ncourse the plastic matter of this grouping and of those lights has its im-\nportance, since without it the actuality of that grouping and that lighting\ncould not be made evident any more than Marconi's electric waves could\nbe made evident without the sending-out and receiving instruments\" (N,\n153). The referential, mimetic, or representational aspect of his works,\nConrad is saying, is all for the sake of providing a necessary material base\nfor bringing something invisible into visibility through an artful arrange-\nment of that material. This figure is consonant with the often-cited pas-\nsage within Heart of Darkness itself about the peculiar nature of Mar-\nlow's stories as opposed to the usual stories seamen tell. I shall return to\nthat passage.\nMuch Conrad criticism recognizes tacitly that Heart of Darkness is\nliterature but then talks about it as if it were something else. Indeed it is\nalmost impossible to avoid making this elementary error, since every text\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n113\ninvites a referential or what Derrida calls, following Sartre, a \"transcen-\ndent\" reading, that is, a reading going beyond the work's language to-\nward the exterior world to which it presumably refers.10 To put this an-\nother way, to call Heart of Darkness a literary work, as I just have, is a\nspeech act that responds to certain possibilities in the text. I have im-\nplicitly said, \"I declare Heart of Darkness is literature.\" It would be\nequally possible to declare that Heart of Darkness is history, or memoir,\nor autobiography. To do this would be in one way or another to label the\nnovel a straightforwardly mimetic or referential work that deserves to\nbe judged by its truth value, its accuracy of representation. Many critics\nhave done just that. No distinguishing marks certainly identify a given\ntext as literary or as nonliterary, in spite of the many conventional codes\nthat ordinarily indicate a text is literature or not literature. This uncer-\ntainty results from the way each may present itself in the guise of the\nother. A page from a telephone book can be taken as literature. One can\nimagine a fictitious telephone book that would look exactly like a real\none, though the numbers would not work if you were to try to use them\nto call someone.\nIf taking Heart of Darkness as literature or as not literature is a speech\nact, an act of belief or of bearing witness, not a constative statement, this\nmeans that whoever declares it to be one or the other must take responsi-\nbility for his or her declaration. He or she must say, \"I did it. I have\ndeclared that Heart of Darkness is literature (or, on the contrary, is his-\ntory or autobiography). I accept responsibility for the consequences of\nsaying that.\" I hereby do that now for my claim that Heart of Darkness\nbelongs to literature. To say Heart of Darkness is a literary work, I hasten\nto add, by no means exonerates Conrad from responsibility for what is\nsaid within it, but it does change the terms and conditions of that respon-\nsibility. Just how?\nLiterature as an institution in the West is of relatively recent date. It\nbegan more or less in the Renaissance. \"Literature\" as we Westerners\nknow it is a radically overdetermined historical product belonging only\nto Western societies. Greek tragedy is not literature in the modern West-\nern sense, nor is classical Chinese poetry, however much these may look\nlike more or less the same thing as our literature. Greek tragedy was a\nspecies of quasi-religious ritual, and Chinese poetry had class and institu-\ntional functions, not to speak of a texture of political or historical allu-\nsions, that were not quite like anything in the West. Whether United\nStates so-called literature or South African Anglophone so-called litera-\nture is literature in the same sense that Conrad's Heart of Darkness is\nliterature is a subtle and difficult question, a question whose answer must\nby no means be taken for granted. I suspect the nature and social function\nof United States and South African literature are significantly different\n\n\n114 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nfrom those of British literature. Certainly it is difficult, for example, to\napply (without distorting them) to Melville, Hawthorne, or Dickinson\nparadigms developed for English Victorian literature, though they are\ncontemporary with it.\nLiterature in the modern Western sense is a concomitant of democracy\nwith its precious right to free speech, of the modern nation-state, of Euro-\npean worldwide economic and political imperialist hegemony, of print\nculture, of modern notions of authorship, of copyright laws, and of post-\nCartesian notions of subjectivity and of the subject/object dichotomy.\nDemocratic freedom of speech, as guaranteed by a particular nation state,\nis, as Jacques Derrida has cogently argued in the prefatory interview in\nActs of Literature, essential to literature in the modern European sense.\nSince it would be difficult to convict Derrida of either racism or sexism\n(though attempts have been made), his testimony may be valuable here in\nworking out how to pass judgment on Heart of Darkness. Though of\ncourse free speech always has its limits and is never more than imperfectly\nachieved, always something yet to come, nevertheless in principle it\nmakes literature possible by making it permissible to say anything and, in\na certain specific sense, to disclaim responsibility for it by saying, \"That\nis not me speaking but an imaginary character. I am exercising my right\nto free speech in the name of a higher responsibility.\"11\nAll these features I have named (democratic free speech, the nation\nstate, European hegemony, print culture, copyright laws, Cartesian no-\ntions of the ego), make a heterogeneous system, of which literature in the\nmodern Western sense is only one element. If one element is changed, the\nwhole system is changed, including any member of it. Several of these\nintertwined elements are in our time being radically altered. We hear on\nall sides these days of the decline of the nation state. Cartesian or He-\ngelian notions of subjectivity are no longer taken for granted, to say\nthe least. Print culture is being rapidly replaced by a new regime of tele-\ncommunications: television, cinema, videotapes, faxes, e-mail, computer\ndatabases, the Internet with its unimaginable and incoherent multiplicity\nof data, including literature (that is being transformed by this new me-\ndium) and literary scholarship\u2014all floating freely in global cyberspace.\nAmong all that chaotic wealth I discovered, for example, a hypercard\nversion of Heart of Darkness and downloaded it into my computer. It\nwas prepared partly in Florida, partly in Norway, though the e-mail ad-\ndress is Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Reading Heart of Dark-\nness in this version is different in many hard-to-define ways from reading\nit in a printed book. We live in a postcolonial world in which Europe and\neven the United States are less and less dominant, as, for example, East\nAsian economies challenge the hegemony of Western ones in size and\nglobal power. Freedom of speech on the Internet does not mean the same\n\n\nCONRAD: \nHEART \nOF \nDARKNESS \n115\nthing as freedom of speech in face-to-face encounters in an old-fashioned\nNew England town meeting, or freedom of speech as exercised in a\nprinted text. The result of these changes may be that we are coming to the\nend of Western-style literature as it extended from Shakespeare to Con-\nrad and his European contemporaries. The study of this literature was\ninstitutionalized in departments of national literatures in Western-style\nuniversities all over the world. Those universities are part of the legacy of\nimperialism and colonialism.\nLiterature in the modern Western sense is, it may be, already a thing of\nthe past. It is now an object of historical investigation and imaginative,\nspectral resurrection, not something that is or could be currently pro-\nduced, since the enabling conditions have changed so radically. Misread-\nings of Heart of Darkness as though it were a straightforwardly his-\ntorical, referential, or autobiographical document may be evidence that\nliterature can no longer easily be understood in terms of older protocols,\ncodes, and conventions of reading, though of course such mimetic mis-\nreadings of literature have always been current. They too are part of our\nlegacy from the now-vanishing regime of print culture. As I have said, a\nfictional telephone book can always be taken as a real one. The need for\nthe ritual disclaimer (often a manifestly lying one) saying \"any resem-\nblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental\" testifies to\nthe ubiquity of the confusion and the need to try to ward it off.\nIn just what way does Heart of Darkness invite reading as literature\nrather than, say, as a historical account or as an autobiography? The\nmost obvious way is in the displacement from Conrad to two imaginary\nnarrators, neither of whom is to be identified with Conrad, any more than\nSocrates, in the Platonic dialogues, is to be identified with Plato. The\nreader who says Conrad speaks directly for himself either in the words\nof the frame narrator or in Marlow's words does so at his or her peril\nand in defiance of the most elementary literary conventions. Whatever\nthe frame narrator or Marlow says is ironized or suspended, presented\nimplicitly in parabasis, by being given as the speech of an imaginary\ncharacter.\nConrad's way of talking about Marlow's origin, nature, and relation\nto his creator is peculiar, evasive. It is a little like the response \"R.,\" pre-\nsumably Rousseau himself, though this is not confirmed, gives, in the\nsecond preface to Rousseau's La nouvelle Heloise, when he is asked by\n\"N.\" whether the letters that make up the novel are real letters or fictive\nones. \"R.\" says he does not know and, when pressed by \"N.,\" says he is\nafraid of lying if he answers definitely one way or the other.12 In the \"Au-\nthor's Note\" of 1917 to Youth, the volume that contains Heart of Dark-\nness, as well as \"Youth\" (in which Marlow first appeared) and \"The End\n\n\n116 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nof the Tether,\" Conrad responds to \"some literary speculation\" about\nMarlow's \"origins.\" \"One would think that I am the proper person to\nthrow a light on the matter;\" says Conrad, \"but in truth I find that it isn't\nso easy\" (N, 155). Marlow, he goes on to say, \"was supposed to be all\nsorts of things: a clever screen, a mere device, a 'personator,' a familiar\nspirit, a whispering 'daemon.' I myself have been suspected of a meditated\nplan for his capture\" (ibid.). Conrad continues to talk ironically and am-\nbiguously about Marlow as if he were a real not a fictive person. Or\nrather he speaks of Marlow as a fictive person whose existence is never-\ntheless inseparable from that of Conrad himself in the sense that neither\nwould \"care\" to survive the other:\nThat is not so. I made no plans [to \"capture\" him]. The man Marlow and I\ncame together in the casual manner of those health-resort acquaintances\nwhich sometimes ripen into friendships. This one has ripened. For all his\nassertiveness in matters of opinion he is not an intrusive person. He haunts\nmy hours of solitude, when, in silence, we lay our heads together in great\ncomfort and harmony; but as we part at the end of a tale I am never sure that\nit may not be for the last time. Yet I don't think that either of us would care\nmuch to survive the other. In his case, at any rate, his occupation would be\ngone and he would suffer from that extinction, because I suspect him of\nsome vanity. (Ibid.)\nBy denying that he had made premeditated plans for Marlow's capture,\nConrad means to deny, I assume, that Marlow was the product of a calcu-\nlated literary artifice. He just appeared, spontaneously, like a ghostly\ndouble or like that \"secret sharer\" who appears on the protagonist's ship\nin \"The Secret Sharer,\" subject of the next chapter of this book. Marlow\nappears to \"haunt\" Conrad's hours of solitude, that is, the hours he does\nhis writing. They then \"part at the end of a tale.\" A ghost, especially one's\nown specter, is both the same as oneself and yet different. This one has\nhis own assertive opinions. These are not, Conrad implies, Conrad's\nown opinions, any more than Kurtz's opinions are the same as Marlow's.\nJust as Conrad is \"haunted\" by Marlow, so Marlow is haunted by Kurtz,\nwho is spoken of repeatedly as a ghost. Marlow speaks of \"the shade\nof Mr. Kurtz,\" \"this initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere\" (65\u2014\n66), of Kurtz as an \"apparition\" (76), a \"shadow\" or \"Shadow\" (81,\n82), \"like a vapour exhaled by the earth\" (82), again as a \"shade\" (85),\nas \"an eloquent phantom\" (94), as a \"disinterred body\" (64). A ghost\ndoes not, cannot, die. It returns, as a revenant, just as Marlow hears\nKurtz's voice still whispering his last words when he visits the Intended\nback in Europe: \"The dusk was repeating them in a persistent whisper all\naround us\" (94).\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n117\nHeart of Darkness is made of a chain of these ambiguous doublings and\nhauntings: of Marlow by Kurtz, of the primary narrator by Marlow, of\nConrad by Marlow, of the Intended by the African woman who is presum-\nably Kurtz's mistress, and of the reader by the whole series. The reader is\nhaunted by the tale, made to feel a \"faint uneasiness\" by it just as the frame\nnarrator is by Marlow's story (43). The reader pores over and over the text\ntrying to come to terms with it so it can be dismissed and forgotten.\nA second way Heart of Darkness presents itself as literature is in the elab-\norate tissue of figures and other rhetorical devices that make up, as one\nmight put it, the texture of the text. The simplest and most obvious of\nthese devices is the use of similes, signaled by \"like\" or \"as.\" These similes\ndisplace things that are named by one or the other of the narrators. They\nassert that this (whatever it is) is like something else. This something else\nforms through recurrence a consistent subtext. This subtext functions as\na counterpoint defining everything that can be seen as a veil hiding some-\nthing more truthful or essential behind.\nThe first of many uses of the \nfigure \nnaming things veils that are lifted to\nreveal more veils behind comes when the frame narrator, describing the\nevening scene just before sunset, when the sky is \"a benign immensity of\nunstained light\" (N, 4), as it looks from the Nellie at anchor in the\nThames estuary, says: \"the very mist on the Essex marshes was like [my\nemphasis] a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland,\nand draping the low shores in diaphanous folds\" (18). Such recurrent\nfigures establish a structure that is apocalyptic in the etymological sense\nof \"unveiling,\" as well as in the sense of having to do with death, judg-\nment, and other last things.\nThese similes, as they follow in a line punctuating the text at rhythmic\nintervals, are not casual or fortuitous. They form a system, a powerful\nundertext beneath the first-level descriptive language. They invite the\nreader to see whatever either of the narrators sees and names on the first\nlevel of narration as a veil or screen hiding something invisible or not yet\nvisible behind it. When each veil is lifted, however, it uncovers only an-\nother veil, according to a paradox essential to the genre of the apocalypse.\nApocalypse: the word means \"unveiling\" in Greek. If one had to name\nthe genre to which Heart of Darkness belongs, the answer would be that\nit is a failed apocalypse, or, strictly speaking, since all apocalypses ulti-\nmately fail to lift the last veil, it is just that, a member of the genre apoca-\nlypse. The film modeled on Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now, was\nbrilliantly and accurately named, except for that word \"now.\" Apoca-\nlypse is never now. It is always to come, a thing of the future, both infi-\nnitely distant and immediately imminent.\n\n\n118 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nIn Heart of Darkness it is, to borrow Conrad's own words, as if each\nepisode were \"some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister back-cloth\"\n(28). The novel is structured as a long series of episodes. Each appears\nwith extreme vividness before the reader's imaginary vision, brought\nthere by Conrad's remarkable descriptive power. It then vanishes, to be\nreplaced by the next episode, as though a figured screen had been lifted to\nreveal yet another figured screen behind it. The darkness lies behind them\nall, like that \"sinister back-cloth\" Marlow names. The misty Essex shore\nin the opening frame episode is, in the passage already cited, \"like a gauzy\nand radiant fabric\" (18). The fog that obscures the shore just before Mar-\nlow's ship is attacked is said to have \"lifted as a shutter lifts\" and then to\nhave come down again, \"smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves\" (55).\nThe change that comes over Kurtz's features just before he utters his judg-\nment is \"as though a veil had been rent\" (86), in an explicit reference to\nthe figure of apocalypse as unveiling, revelation, as well as to the rending\nof the Temple veil at the time of Christ's crucifixion.\nHeart of Darkness is structured by this trope of successive revelations.\nThese unveilings unveil not so much the truth behind as the act of unveil-\ning itself, since no \"bottom\" to the series is reached, no ultimate revela-\ntion given. Each scene is in a sense just as close and just as far away from\nthe unnamable \"truth\" behind it as any other. Marlow's journey in Heart\nof Darkness and that of the reader as he or she gets deeper and deeper into\nthe book is a movement in place. The scene on the Nellie is replaced by\nthe scenes in the offices of the trading company in the sepulchral city: the\ntwo old women in black at the entrance, knitting and knitting, like two\nFates; the doctor who measures Marlow's head and says \"the changes\ntake place inside, you know\" (26). These scenes give place to the sequence\nof brief episodes that makes up the central story, as Marlow makes his\nway deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness: the French ship firing\npointlessly into the bush (\"Pop, would go one of the six-inch guns; a\nsmall flame would dart and vanish, a little white smoke would disappear,\na tiny projectile would give a feeble screech\u2014and nothing happened.\nNothing could happen\" [29]); the dying \"workers\" in the grove of death;\nthe starched and scented accountant, keeping perfect records in the midst\nof pointless confusion; the corpse with a bullet-hole in its forehead Mar-\nlow \"absolutely stumble[s]\"(35) upon during his two-hundred-mile trek\nto reach the beginning of inland navigation on the river, where he finds\nhis ship has been wrecked; his encounter with the skeleton of his prede-\ncessor, who has been killed in an absurd dispute over two chickens; the\nstorage shed at the Central Station that suddenly bursts into flames in the\nmiddle of the night; the macabre dance on the tinpot steamer's deck per-\nformed by Marlow and the chief mechanic to celebrate their expecta-\ntion that rivets will come; the Eldorado Exploring Expedition, with its\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n119\n\"absurd air of disorderly flight with the loot of innumerable outfit shops\nand provision stores,\" which vanishes \"into the patient wilderness, that\nclosed upon it as the sea closes over a diver\" (46, 49); the finding of the\nbook about seamanship, Towson's Inquiry, annotated in what Marlow\ntakes to be cipher; the death of Marlow's African helmsman as the ship\napproaches Kurtz's station and is attacked from the shore; the encounter\nat the station with the Russian dressed like a harlequin; the appearance\nthrough Marlow's telescope of those \"symbolic\" heads on stakes; Mar-\nlow's rescue of Kurtz when the latter tries to crawl back to join the Afri-\ncans he has commanded and bewitched, so that they worship him; the\napparition on the shore of what the reader supposes is Kurtz's African\nmistress; Kurtz's death and summing up, \"in a whisper at some image, at\nsome vision\u2014. . . 'The horror! The horror!'\" (86); the echo or repetition\nof the African woman's gesture of raising her arms in the final episode of\nMarlow's encounter back in Europe with Kurtz's \"Intended,\" when he\ntells his lie; the return in the final brief paragraph to the deck of the Nellie\nwhere Marlow has been telling his story and to the concluding vision of\nthe Thames as a \"tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the\nearth [that] flowed sombre under an overcast sky\u2014seemed to lead into\nthe heart of an immense darkness\" (95).\nYou may say that of course any narrative consists of a sequence of\nepisodes that give place to one another. Heart of Darkness is nothing\nspecial in doing that. The difference, however, is in the way the materials\nand personages of each episode vanish, never to return again except in\nMarlow's memory. A novel roughly contemporary with Heart of Dark-\nness, Henry James's The Wings of the Dove, for example, consists of a\nseries of episodes all right, but the same characters are returned to again\nand again in a slow rotation of encounters that advances the action. In\nHeart of Darkness each episode is like a separate sinister farce enacted\nbefore a black backcloth. The whole is like a sequence of dream visions,\neach with little connection to the ones before and after. Each vanishes for\ngood, as though a veil had been lifted to reveal yet another such scene\nbehind it that vanishes in its turn, in a rhythm of ironic undercutting and\ndisplacement that punctuates Marlow's journey. He journeys deeper and\ndeeper toward the fulfillment of an implicit promise, the promise to make\nor find a final revelation or unveiling. That promise, it hardly needs say-\ning, is never kept. It cannot be kept. Just why that is so and just what that\nnonfulfillment means remain to be seen.\nA third distinctively literary feature of Heart of Darkness has already\nbeen named in passing. The novel is ironic through and through. The\nreader might wish this were not the case. We may deplore Conrad's\nradical irony, but there it is, an indubitable fact. Heart of Darkness is a\n\n\n120 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nmasterwork of irony, as when the eloquent idealism of Kurtz's pamphlet\non \"The Suppression of Savage Customs\" is undercut by the phrase\nscrawled at the bottom: \"Exterminate all the brutes!\" (66), or as when the\ndying Africans in the grove of death are called \"helpers\" in the great\n\"work\" of civilizing the continent (32). Marlow's narrative in particular\nis steeped in irony throughout. The problem is that it is impossible to be\ncertain just how to take that irony. Irony is, as Hegel and Kierkegaard\nsaid, \"infinite absolute negativity,\" or, as Friedrich Schlegel said, a \"per-\nmanent parabasis,\" a continuous suspension of clearly identifiable mean-\ning. It is a principle of unintelligibility, or, in Schlegel's word, JJnver-\nstdndlichkeit.u Irony is a constant local feature of Marlow's narrative\nstyle. He says one thing and means another, as when the Europeans at the\nCentral Station engaged in the terrible work of imperialist conquest, the\n\"merry dance of death and trade\" (29), are said to be, in yet another\nsimile, like \"pilgrims\": \"They wandered here and there with their absurd\nlong staves in their hands, like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside\na rotten fence\" (38).\nThis stylistic undercutting is mimed in that larger structure of the re-\nplacement of each episode by the next, so that each is undermined by the\nreader's knowledge that it is only a temporary appearance, not some ulti-\nmate goal of revelation attained. Each is certain to vanish and be replaced\nby the next scene to be enacted before that sinister backcloth.\nA fourth ostentatious literary feature of Heart of Darkness is the use of\nrecurrent prosopopoeias. The personification of the darkness (whatever\nthat word means here) begins in the title, which gives the darkness a\n\"heart.\" Prosopopoeia is the ascription of a name, a face, or a voice to the\nabsent, the inanimate, or the dead. By a speech act, a performative utter-\nance, prosopopoeia creates the fiction of a personality where in reality\nthere is none. Or is there? Once the personifications are in place, it seems\nas if the personality had been there all along, waiting to be recognized by\na name. All prosopopoeias are also catachreses. They move the verbal\nfiction of a personality over to name something unknown and unknow-\nable. The \"something\" is, therefore, strictly speaking, unnamable in any\nliteral language. It is something radically other than human personality:\nsomething absent, inanimate, or dead. It is no accident that so many tra-\nditional examples of catachresis are also personifications: \"headland,\"\n\"face of a mountain,\" \"tongue of land,\" \"table leg.\" The phrase \"heart\nof darkness\" is such a catachrestic prosopopoeia, to give it its barbarous-\nsounding Greek rhetorical name. We project our own bodies on the land-\nscape and on surrounding artifacts. In Heart of Darkness the proso-\npopoeias are a chief means of naming by indirection what Conrad calls,\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n121\nin a misleading and inadequate metaphor, \"the darkness,\" or, \"the wil-\nderness,\" or, most simply and perhaps most truthfully, \"it.\"\nMore than a dozen explicit personifications of this \"it\" rhythmically\npunctuate Heart of Darkness, like a recurring leitmotif. The darkness is\nnot really a person, but an \"it,\" asexual or transsexual, impersonal, indif-\nferent, though to Marlow it seems like a person. The wilderness sur-\nrounding the Central Station, says Marlow, \"struck me as something\ngreat and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing\naway of this fantastic invasion\" (38). A little later Marlow says \"the si-\nlence of the land went home to one's very heart\u2014its mystery, its great-\nness, the amazing reality of its concealed life\" (41). Of that silent, noctur-\nnal wilderness Marlow asserts, \"All this was great, expectant, mute,\nwhile the man [one of the agents at the station] jabbered about himself. I\nwondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us\ntwo were meant as an appeal or as a menace... . Could we handle that\ndumb thing, or would it handle us? I felt how big, how confoundedly big,\nwas that thing that couldn't talk and perhaps was deaf as well\" (42). \"It\nwas the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable in-\ntention. It looked at you with a vengeful aspect.... I felt often its mysteri-\nous stillness watching me at my monkey-tricks, just as it watches you\nfellows [his listeners on the Nellie] performing on your respective tight-\nropes for\u2014what is it? half a crown a tumble\u2014\" (49, 50). The wilderness\ndestroys Kurtz by a kind of diabolical seduction: \"The wilderness had\npatted him on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball\u2014an ivory ball; it\nhad caressed him, and\u2014lo!\u2014he had withered; it had taken him, loved\nhim, embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his\nsoul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initia-\ntion. He was its spoiled and pampered favourite\" (64). The Africans at\nKurtz's Inner Station vanish \"without any perceptible movement of re-\ntreat, as if the forest that had ejected these beings so suddenly had drawn\nthem in again as the breath is drawn in a long aspiration\" (76).\nThis last citation indicates another and not unpredictable feature of the\nprosopopoeias in Heart of Darkness. The personification of the wilder-\nness is matched by a corresponding transformation of the African people\nwho intervene between Marlow and the \"it.\" Just as, in Thomas Hardy's\nThe Return of the Native, the extravagant personification of the night-\ntime heath that opens the novel leads to the assertion that Eustacia Vye,\nwho rises from a mound on the heath to stand outlined in the darkness,\nis, so to speak, the personification of the personification, its exposure or\nvisible embodiment, so, in Heart of Darkness, all the Africans Marlow\nmeets are visible representatives and symbols of the \"it.\" Though it may\nbe racist for Marlow (who is not necessarily Conrad, the reader should\n\n\n122 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nremember) to see the Africans as an inscrutably \"other,\" as simple \"sav-\nages\" or \"primitives,\" when their culture is older than any European one\nand just as complex or sophisticated, if not more so, this otherness is\nstressed for the primary purpose of making the Africans visible embodi-\nments and proofs that the \"it,\" the darkness, is a person.\nThis personification of personification is an underlying feature of all\nMarlow's prosopopoeias, but it is made most explicit in the scene where\nthe woman the reader may presume is Kurtz's African mistress appears\non the shore:\nShe was savage and superb, wild-eyed and magnificent; there was something\nominous and stately in her deliberate progress. And in the hush that had\nfallen suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land, the immense wilderness, the\ncolossal body of the fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her, pen-\nsive, as though it had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous and\npassionate soul. . . . She stood looking at us without a stir, and like the wil-\nderness itself, with an air of brooding over an inscrutable purpose. (77)\nThis passage, like the one describing the way the wilderness has seduced\nKurtz, seems to indicate that this \"it\" is after all gendered. It is female, a\ncolossal body of fecund and mysterious life. Since the wilderness is sup-\nposed to represent a mysterious knowledge, \"like evil or truth,\" this per-\nsonification does not jibe very well with the \"sexist\" assertions Marlow\nmakes about the way women in general, for example Marlow's aunt or\nKurtz's Intended, are \"out of it,\" invincibly innocent and ignorant. At the\nleast one would have to say that two contradictory sexist myths about\nwomen are ascribed to Marlow. One is the European male's tendency to\npersonify the earth as a great mother, full of an immemorial, seductive\nwisdom. The other is the European male's tendency to condescend to\nwomen as innately incapable of seeing into things as well as men can.\nStrong hints of homosexual or at least homosocial relations complicate\nthe sexual politics of Heart of Darkness. Other critics have seen this in\nConrad's work. Those businessmen gathered on the Nellie for a weekend\naway from any women are a splendid example of what Eve Sedgwick\nmeans by male homosociality. The pleasure yacht is suggestively, though\nof course also conventionally, given a familiar woman's name. Most of\nthe doublings that organize the novel are of male by male, in that long\nchain I have identified. The most important of these is Marlow's infatua-\ntion with Kurtz, his extravagant fidelity to him, even beyond the grave. I\nhave scrupulously in this chapter referred to the reader as \"he or she.\" A\nmoment's reflection, however, will show that men and women are un-\nlikely to read the novel in just the same way or to feel just the same kind\nof obligation to account for it, to render it justice. Both genders will have\nthat obligation, but each in a different way.\n\n\nCONRAD: \nHEART \nOF \nDARKNESS \n123\nThe final scene pits Marlow's intimacy with Kurtz against the In-\ntended's. \"Intimacy grows quickly out there,\" Marlow tells the Intended.\n\"I knew him as well as it is possible for one man to know another\" (92).\nA strong suggestion is made that Marlow is jealous of the Intended, as a\nman who loves another man is jealous of that man's heterosexual loves.\nMarcel Proust, however, who presumably knew about this, has Marcel in\nA la recherche du temps perdu claim that the Baron de Charlus was only\njealous of his lovers' other male lovers, not at all of their heterosexual\npartners. In any case, to the other doublings I have listed would need to\nbe added the way Marlow doubles the particolored Russian in his fasci-\nnation with Kurtz. Again hints are given that Marlow envies the Russian\nhis intimacy with Kurtz. He wants to have Kurtz all to himself, to be\nKurtz's sole survivor, so to speak, the sole keeper of his memory. The only\novert reference to homosexuality occurs in an interchange between Mar-\nlow and the Russian: \"We talked of everything,' he [the Russian] said,\nquite transported at the recollection. 'I forgot there was such a thing as\nsleep. The night did not seem to last an hour. Everything! Everything! . . .\nOf love too.' 'Ah, he talked to you of love!' I said, much amused. 'It isn't\nwhat you think,' he cried, almost passionately. 'It was in general. He\nmade me see things\u2014things'\" (71-72).\nConrad's invention of Marlow at once embodies, reveals, and ironi-\ncally puts in question the complex system of Western imperialist and cap-\nitalist ideology. I mean \"invention\" here in both senses\u2014as \nfinding \nand as\nmaking up. Among the ingredients of this system are not just a certain\n\"sexist\" vision of women but also a strand of homosociality or even ho-\nmosexuality. This was certainly an important feature of English society in\nConrad's day. It has also been shown to be a feature of the imperialist\nenterprise generally, for example in the European presentation of non-\nEuropean men as exotic, often even, in an obvious wish-fulfillment, as\nsexually perverse.\nAll four of the stylistic features I have identified\u2014the use of fictional\nnarrators, of recurrent tropes, of irony, and of personification\u2014consti-\ntute a demand that Heart of Darkness be read as literature, as opposed\nto being taken as a straightforwardly mimetic or referential work that\nwould allow the reader to hold Conrad himself directly responsible for\nwhat is said as though he were a journalist or a travel writer. Of course\nany of these features can be used in a nonliterary work, but taken all\ntogether as they are intertwined in Heart of Darkness, they invite the\nreader to declare, \"This is literature.\"\nIn the name of what higher responsibility does Conrad justify all this\n\"literary\" indirection and ironic undercutting, all this suspending or re-\ndirecting of his novel's straightforwardly mimetic aspect? In the name of\n\n\n124 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nwhat higher obligation is everything that is referentially named in a\npseudo-historical or mimetic way displaced by these ubiquitous rhetori-\ncal devices and made into a sign for something else? If Heart of Darkness\nis a literary work rather than history or autobiography, just what kind of\nliterary work is it? Just what kind of apocalypse, if it is an apocalypse?\nWhat lies behind that veil? The frame narrator, in a passage often cited\nand commented on, gives the reader a precious clue to an answer to these\nquestions, though it is left to the reader to make use of the clue in his or\nher reading:\nThe yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which\nlies within the shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if his\npropensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode\nwas not inside like a kernel but outside [the ms has \"outside in the unseen\"],\nenveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in\nthe likeness of one of those misty halos that sometimes are made visible by\nthe spectral illumination of moonshine. (20)\n\"To spin yarns\" is a cliche for narration. To tell a story is to join many\nthreads together to make a continuous line leading from here to there. Of\nthat yarn cloth may be woven, the whole cloth of the truth as opposed to\na lie that, as the proverbial saying has it, is \"made up out of whole cloth.\"\nThe lie as cloth makes a web, screen, or veil covering a truth that remains\nhidden behind or within. This inside/outside opposition governs the nar-\nrator's distinction between two kinds of tales. On the one hand, the first\nkind is the sort of seaman's yarn it has been assumed by many reader's\nand critics Conrad was telling in his stories and novels. The meaning of\nsuch a tale lies within, like the kernel within the shell of a cracked nut. I\ntake it this names a realistic, mimetic, referential tale with an obvious\npoint and moral. Marlow's tales, on the other hand, and by implication\nthis one by Conrad, since so much of it is made up of Marlow's narration,\nhave a different way of making meaning. All the visible, representational\nelements, all that the tale makes you see, according to that famous claim\nby Conrad in the preface to The Nigger of the \"Narcissus\", that his goal\nwas \"before all, to make you see,\"14 axe there not for their own sakes, as\nnumerically valuable and verifiable, for example for the sake of giving the\nreader information about imperialism in the Belgian Congo. Those ele-\nments have as their function to make something else visible, what the\nmanuscript calls the \"unseen,\"15 perhaps even the unseeable, as the dark\nmatter of the universe or the putative black holes at the center of galaxies\ncan in principle never be seen, only inferred.\nConrad's figure is a different one from those black holes about which\nhe could not have known, though his trope is still astronomical. It is an\nexample of that peculiar sort of figure that can be called a \nfigure \nof figure\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n125\nor a \nfigure \nof figuration. Just as the mist on a dark night is invisible except\nwhen it is made visible as a circular halo around moonlight, light already\nsecondary and reflected from the sun, and just as the mimetic elements of\nMarlow's tale are secondary to the putatively real things they represent at\none remove, so the meaning of Marlow's yarns is invisible in itself and is\nnever named directly. It is not inside the tale but outside. It is \"brought\nout\" indirectly by the things that are named and recounted, thereby made\nvisible, just as, for example, Marlow when he visits the Intended hears\nKurtz's last words breathed in a whisper by the dusk: \"The dusk was\nrepeating them in a persistent whisper all around us, in a whisper that\nseemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind. 'The\nhorror! The horror!'\" (94). The reader will note the way the whispered\nsound is onomatopoetically echoed here in the repetition three times of\nthe word \"whisper,\" with its aspirant and sibilant \"whuh\" and \"isp\"\nsounds. The illumination provided by the tale is \"spectral,\" like a liminal,\nghostly sound. It turns everything into a phantom, that is, into something\nthat has come back from the dead, something that cannot die, something\nthat will always, sooner or later, just when we least expect it, come again.\nThe miniature lesson in aesthetic theory the frame narrator presents\nhere is an admirably succinct expression of the distinction between mi-\nmetic literature and apocalyptic, parabolic, or allegorical literature. In the\nlatter, everything named, with however much verisimilitude, stands for\nsomething else that is not named directly, that cannot be named directly.\nIt can only be inferred by those that have eyes to see and ears to hear and\nunderstand, as Jesus puts it in explaining the parable of the sower in\nMatthew 13. All these genres have to do with promising, with death, with\nthe truly secret, and with last things, \"things,\" as Jesus says, \"which have\nbeen kept secret from the foundation of the world\" (Matt. 13:35).\nIt is not so absurd as it might seem to claim that Heart of Darkness is\na secular version of what are, originally at least, intertwined religious or\nsacred genres: apocalypse, parable, and allegory. Conrad himself spoke\nof the \"piety\" of his approach to writing and of his motive as quasi-\nreligious. \"One thing that I am certain of,\" he wrote in that letter to\nSymons already quoted, \"is that I have approached the object of my task,\nthings human, in a spirit of piety. The earth is a temple where there is\ngoing on a mystery play childish and poignant, ridiculous and awful\nenough in all conscience. Once in I've tried to behave decently. I have not\ndegraded the quasi religious sentiment by tears and groans: and if I've\nbeen amused and indifferent, I've neither grinned nor gnashed my teeth\"\n(N, 154).\nIn the case of Heart of Darkness, just what is that \"something else\" for\nthe revelation of which the whole story is written? The clear answer is\nthat the something else is the \"it\" that Marlow's narration so persistently\n\n\n126 \nCHAPTER FIVE\npersonifies and that Kurtz passes judgment on when he says \"The hor-\nror! \" All details in the story, all the mimetic and verisimilar elements, are\npresented for the sake of bringing out a glimpse of that \"it.\" The revela-\ntion of this \"it\" is promised by the frame narrator when he defines the\ncharacteristic indirection of meaning in Marlow's yarns. Many critics of\nHeart of Darkness have made the fundamental mistake of taking the\nstory as an example of the first kind of seaman's yarn. Those critics, like\nF. R. Leavis, who have noticed all the language about the unspeakable\nand \"inscrutable\" \"it\" have almost universally condemned it as so much\nmoonshine interfering with Conrad's gift for making you see the mate-\nrial world, his gift for descriptive vividness and verisimilitude. At least\nsuch critics have taken the trouble to read carefully and have noticed that\nthere are important verbal elements in the text that must be accounted for\nsomehow and that do not fit the straightforward mimetic, descriptive\nparadigm.\nIs the \"something,\" the \"it,\" ever revealed, ever brought into the open\nwhere it may be seen and judged? The clear answer is that it is not. The\n\"it\" remains to the end unnamable, inscrutable, unspeakable. The \"it\" is\nConrad's particular version, in Heart of Darkness at least, of those\n\"others\" that are the subject of this book. The \"it\" is falsely, or at any\nrate unprovably, personified by Marlow's rhetoric as having conscious-\nness and intention. It is named only indirectly and inadequately by all\nthose similes and figures of veils being lifted. How could something be\nrevealed that can only be encountered directly by those who have crossed\nover the threshold of death? The reader is told that \"it\" is \"The horror!\"\nbut just what that means is never explained except in hints and indirec-\ntions. Nothing definite can be said of the \"it\" except that it is not nothing,\nthat it is, though even that is not certain, since it may be a projection, not\na solicitation, call, or demand from something wholly other. Of the \"it\"\none must say what Wallace Stevens says of the \"primitive like an orb,\"\n\"at the center on the horizon\": \"It is and it/Is not and, therefore, is.\"16 If\n\"it\" is wholly other it is wholly other. Nothing more can be said of it\nexcept by signs that confess in their proffering to their inadequacy. Each\nveil lifts to reveal another veil behind.\nThe structure of Heart of Darkness is a self-perpetuating system of an\nendlessly deferred promise. This is the implicit promise that Marlow\nmakes at the beginning of his tale when he says that though his meeting\nwith Kurtz, \"the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of\nmy experience,\" was \"not very clear,\" nevertheless \"it seemed to throw a\nkind of light\" (7). This illumination he implicitly promises to pass on to\nhis hearers. The primary narrator passes it on to us, the readers. The\nfulfillment of this promise to reveal, however, remains always future,\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n127\nsomething yet to come, eschatological or messianic rather than teleologi-\ncal. It is an end that can never come within the series of episodes that\nreaches out toward it as life reaches toward death. In this Heart of Dark-\nness works in a deferral analogous to the way Revelations promises an\nimminent messianic coming that always remains future, to come, beyond\nthe last in the series, across the threshold into another realm and another\nregime. It is in the name of this unrevealed and unrevealable secret, out of\nobligation to it, in response to the demand it makes, though it still re-\nmains secret and inaccessible, that all Heart of Darkness is written. The\npresence within the novel of an inaccessible secret, a secret that neverthe-\nless incites to narration, is what makes it appropriate to speak of Heart of\nDarkness as literature.\nThe place where this ultimate failure of revelation is made most explicit\nis Marlow's comment on the difference between Kurtz, who summed up\nat the moment of his death, giving words to \"the appalling face of a\nglimpsed truth\" (87), and Marlow's own illness that took him to the\nbrink of death and then back into life again, therefore not quite far\nenough to see what Kurtz saw:\nAnd it is not my own extremity I remember best\u2014a vision of greyness with-\nout form filled with physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanes-\ncence of all things\u2014even of this pain itself. No! It is his extremity that I\nseemed to have lived through. True, he had made that last stride, he had\nstepped over the edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitat-\ning foot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the wisdom,\nand all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed into that inappreciable\nmoment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible. Perhaps!\n(87-88)\nHow would one know without crossing that bourne from which no\ntraveler returns? You cannot \"live through\" another's death. The other\nmust die his or her own death; you must die yours\u2014both in incommuni-\ncable solitude. To \"know\" you must die first. If you know, you are, nec-\nessarily, no longer around to tell the tale. Even knowing this remains,\nnecessarily, a matter of \"perhaps.\" It is, nevertheless, in the name of this\nnonrevelation, this indirect glimpse, as the moon spectrally illuminates a\nring of mist, that Marlow's judgment of imperialism is made. The \"it\"\nis the sinister backcloth before which all the seriocomic antics of those\ncarrying on the merry dance of death and trade, including their racism\nand sexism, are ironically suspended, made to appear both horrible and\nfutile at once. The ubiquity of the \"it\" allows Marlow to imply the iden-\ntity between the African woman and Kurtz's Intended that is so crucial to\nthe story. This ubiquity also allows him to assert an all-important iden-\ntity between the early Roman conquerors of Britain, present-day British\n\n\n128 \nCHAPTER FIVE\ncommerce as represented by the Director of Companies, the Lawyer, and\nthe Accountant, and the enterprise of imperialism in Africa. Of the El-\ndorado Exploring Expedition, Marlow says, \"To tear treasure out of the\nbowels of the land was their desire, with no more moral purpose at the\nback of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe\" (46). Something\nsimilar, however, is said about the Romans near the beginning of Mar-\nlow's narration. It is said in a way that gives it universal application: \"The\nconquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those\nwho have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves,\nis not a pretty thing when you look into it too much\" (21). Heart of\nDarkness looks into it. Early readers saw the novel as an unequivocal\ncondemnation of Leopold II and of Belgian imperialism in the Congo. I\nnote in passing that now (2000), when a new regime has taken over in the\nCongo, transnational companies are fighting for the rights to exploit min-\neral deposits there, for example copper. This new global economy is not\nall that different from the imperialism of Conrad's day. Of course the\nnovel represents, in Marlow, Eurocentric views. It was written by a Euro-\npean with the apparent intent of evaluating such views by embodying\nthem in a narrator. Of course it represents sexist views. It was written to\ndramatize what might be said by an imaginary character, Marlow, a\nwhite male of Conrad's class and time, just as Conrad's critics today rep-\nresent their times, races, sexes, and nations, however superior, more just,\ntheir judgments may be. I claim, however, that by being displaced into\nMarlow as narrator and by being measured against the \"it,\" these Euro-\ncentric views are radically criticized and shown as what they are, that is,\nas elements in a deadly and unjust ideology.\nWhat of Kurtz, however? Is he not different from the other agents of\nimperialism? The latter are possessed by \"a flabby, pretending, weak-\neyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly\" (31). They have no insight\ninto the way they are victims of the imperialist ideology as well as victim-\nizers of those it exploits. Kurtz, on the other hand, \"was a remarkable\nman,\" as Marlow himself repeatedly asserts, in a phrase he picks up from\none of the agents. Kurtz was a kind of universal genius: a painter, a musi-\ncian, a poet (he recites his own poetry to the Russian), spectacularly suc-\ncessful in getting ivory, an extremely gifted journalist, a brilliantly power-\nful speaker, a forceful writer, the author of a stirring pamphlet, his report\nto \"the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs\":\n\" 'By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good practi-\ncally unbounded,' etc. etc. From that point he soared and took me with\nhim. The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember, you\nknow. It gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an august\nBenevolence. It made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the unbounded\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n129\npower of eloquence\u2014of words\u2014of burning noble Words\" (66). Kurtz\nwas potentially a great politician, as the journalist Marlow meets back in\nEurope after Kurtz's death assures him: \"'but Heavens! how that man\ncould talk! He electrified large meetings. He had faith\u2014don't you see\u2014he\nhad the faith. He could get himself to believe anything\u2014anything. He\nwould have been a splendid leader of an extreme party. 'What party?' I\nasked. 'Any party,' answered the other. 'He was an\u2014an\u2014extremist'\"\n(89). The famous scrawled note at the end of the pamphlet's manuscript,\n\"Exterminate all the brutes!\" (66), says with brutal candor the truth, that\nthe suppression of savage customs culminates in the suppression of the\n\"savages\" themselves. That footnote scrawled \"in an unsteady hand\" tes-\ntifies to Kurtz's remarkable understanding of the imperialist, philan-\nthropic, and missionary enterprise.\nJust what goes wrong with Kurtz? His case is obviously of greater in-\nterest than that of any of the others Marlow meets or even than that of\nMarlow himself. The latter has survived and speaks as a sane man, \"one\nof us,\" in the voice of ironic, European, enlightened rationality. Or rather\nhe could be said to speak in that voice except for his fascination with\nKurtz and with that \"it\" that solicits him to speech. What he says of the\nRussian's infatuation with Kurtz could be said of his own fascination:\n\"He had not meditated over it. It came to him, and he accepted it with a\nsort of eager fatalism. I must say that to me it appeared about the most\ndangerous thing in every way he had come upon so far\" (71). Marlow\ngives the reader his diagnosis of Kurtz's \"madness.\" Speaking of those\nheads on stakes, Marlow says:\nthere was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there. They only\nshowed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his various\nlusts, that there was something wanting in him\u2014some small matter which,\nwhen the pressing need arose, could not be found under his magnificent\neloquence. Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I can't say. I think the\nknowledge came to him at last\u2014only at the very last! [The ms originally\nadded here: If so, then justice was done.] But the wilderness had found\nhim out early, and had taken on him a terrible vengeance for the fantastic\ninvasion. I think that it whispered to him things about himself which he did\nnot know, things of which he had no conception till he took counsel with\nthis great solitude\u2014and the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating. It\nechoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core. (58-59)\nOn the one hand, the story of Kurtz's degradation is an example of\nthe familiar narrative cliche of the European who \"goes native.\" Kurtz,\nlike Lingard in The Rescue, like Lord Jim in Lord Jim, and like Charles\nGould in Nostromo, crosses over a border and ceases to be wholly Euro-\npean. Kurtz sets himself up as a sort of king in the alien land, thereby\n\n\n130 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nanticipating the destiny of most colonies to become ultimately indepen-\ndent nations. In doing so, they thereby betray in one way or another the\nideals, the ethos, the laws and conventions of the colonizing country. The\nUnited States did that in 1776. The somewhat hysterical fear that this will\nhappen, or that it will necessarily be a disaster if it does happen, has\nhaunted the colonial enterprise from the beginning. On the other hand,\nKurtz never completely makes that break. After all, he allows Marlow to\nrescue him when he has crawled back ashore in his attempt to join the\nAfricans who have become his subjects. He dies oriented toward Europe\nand toward the desire that he will \"have kings meet him at railway sta-\ntions on his return from some ghastly Nowhere, where he intended to\naccomplish great things\" (85).\nWhat goes wrong with Kurtz? How might he, or another person, Mar-\nlow for example, protect himself from the corrupting whisper of the wil-\nderness? Just here Marlow's rhetoric, or Conrad's rhetoric as ascribed to\nMarlow, is contradictory. It is contradictory in an interesting and symp-\ntomatic way. Marlow names several different ways to protect oneself\nfrom the threat of counterinvasion by the \"it\" that has entered Kurtz\nbecause he is \"hollow at the core\" (74).\nOne way is blind insensitivity: \"Of course a fool, what with sheer\nfright and fine sentiments, is always safe\" (52). That includes most of the\n\"pilgrims,\" the agents of imperialism.\nAnother way to protect oneself from the darkness is through devotion\nto hard but routine physical or mental work, what Conrad calls \"the\ndevotion to efficiency\" (21). This he identifies as a fundamental feature of\nthe capitalist and imperialist ethos. Indeed it still is a feature of our ideol-\nogy in the United States. The stated mission of the University of Califor-\nnia, for example, is to \"help make California competitive in the global\neconomy.\" University \"downsizing\" for efficiency's sake matches corpo-\nrate downsizing for profit's sake. The starched and scented accountant in\nHeart of Darkness is protected by his fanatical devotion to keeping his\nbooks accurate and neat. Marlow, so he tells the reader, is saved from\nsuccumbing to the darkness through his focus on getting his wrecked\nsteamer back in working order and then getting it safely up the river:\n\"Fine sentiments be hanged. I had no time. I had to mess about with\nwhite-lead and strips of woollen blanket helping to put bandages on\nthose leaky steam-pipes\u2014I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and cir-\ncumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook.\nThere was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man\" (52).\nThe third way to protect oneself seems clear enough. It turns out, how-\never, to be the most equivocal. This is indicated by changes and omissions\nin the manuscript. Just after saying \"the conquest of the earth . . . is not\na pretty thing when you look into it too much,\" Marlow goes on to add:\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n131\n\"What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not a senti-\nmental [ms: mouthing] pretence but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the\nidea\u2014something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacri-\nfice to\" (21). The ironic religious language at the end here sounds a little\nominous. More or less the same thing, however, with much less evident\nirony is asserted much later in the story when Marlow is talking about the\nappeal made to him by the dancing, shouting Africans on the shore: \"Let\nthe fool gape and shudder\u2014the man knows, and can look on without a\nwink. But he must meet that truth [the truth of the \"prehistoric\" men's\ndancing that is closer to the origin of mankind: certainly a familiar racist\ncliche there, since modern African cultures are no closer to the origins of\nmankind than modern European ones are] with his own true stuff\u2014with\nhis own inborn strength. Principles? Principles won't do. Acquisitions,\nclothes, pretty rags\u2014rags that would fly off at the first good shake. No;\nyou want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in this fiendish row\u2014is\nthere? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice too, and for good or\nevil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced\" (52).\nThe contradiction here is a double one. In an excised passage from the\nearly place where, apropos of the Roman invasion of Britain, Marlow\nsays the idea redeems it, he says that he admires the Roman conquerors\njust because they did not have any redeeming idea but were just robbers\nand murderers on a grand scale: \"The best of them is they didn't get up\npretty fictions about it. Was there, I wonder, an association on a philan-\nthropic basis to develop Britain, with some third rate king for a president\nand solemn old senators discoursing about it approvingly and philoso-\nphers with uncombed beards praising it, and men in market places crying\nit up. Not much! And that's what I like!\" (from the ms, cited N, 7). No\ndoubt this was cut in part because it was too overt an attack on King\nLeopold, but it is also in direct contradiction to Marlow's claim a mo-\nment later in the published version, just after where the cut passage would\nhave gone, that \"what redeems it [imperialism whether Roman or mod-\nern] is the idea only. An idea at the back of it;... and an unselfish belief\nin the idea\" (21).\nThe other contradiction, however, lies in that phrase \"deliberate be-\nlief\" and in the way Kurtz is defined as an adept at deliberate belief: \"He\ncould get himself to believe anything\u2014anything\" (89). A deliberate be-\nlief is a contradiction in terms, an oxymoron. You either believe or do\nnot believe. A deliberate belief is a pretense to believe even though you\nknow the belief is a fictional confidence in something that does not exist\nor that you do not really believe exists, in this case a solid base for the\nphilanthropic ideals that justify imperialism. To say \"I declare I believe so\nand so\" or \"I will myself deliberately to believe so and so\" is a paradig-\nmatic speech act of a kind not envisioned by Austin. It is an anomalous\n\n\n132 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nperformative, in the strong sense of anomalous: outside the law. This sort\nof performative creates its own ground out of whole cloth. It lifts itself by\nits own bootstraps. A deliberate belief, praised so unreservedly here by\nMarlow, is, however, what makes Kurtz hollow at the core and so vulner-\nable to invasion by the \"wilderness.\" You must believe and not believe.\nSuch a belief undoes itself in the act of affirming itself. It is hollow at the\ncore. Belief in what? In the capitalist idea, but in that idea as promise, as\nthe promise of an ultimate messianic revelation and an ultimate millen-\nnial reign of peace and prosperity for the whole world. This is that \"ex-\notic Immensity ruled by an august Benevolence\" that Kurtz's pamphlet\npromises is to come. This promise is still being made today on behalf of\nthe new global economy and the new universal regime of scientifico-\nbio-techno-tele-mediatic communications.\nThe reader will perhaps have foreseen the conclusion toward which my\nevidence is drawing me. The complex contradictory system of Kurtz's\nimperialist ideology matches exactly the ideology that proposes a liter-\nary work as the apocalyptic promise of a never-quite-yet-occurring reve-\nlation. It would not be a promise if it were not possible that the promise\nmight not be kept. The literary promise of an always postponed reve-\nlation is strikingly exemplified not only by Marlow's narration but also\nby Heart of Darkness as a whole. Conrad's novel, not just Marlow's fic-\ntive account, fits this paradigm. The novel is made up of a chain of spec-\ntral duplications that is reinforced by formal and figural features I have\ndescribed.\nJust how does Kurtz's ideology repeat that of Marlow and of Conrad?\nThe literary work, for example Heart of Darkness or Marlow's narration\nwithin it, is governed by what Derrida calls \"the exemplary secret of liter-\nature,\"17 This secret makes it possible for the work to be the endlessly\ndeferred promise of a definitive revelation that never occurs. This pattern\nis not only literary but also linguistic. It depends on the way a work of\nliterature is made of language and not of any other material or substance.\nMarlow stresses over and over that though Kurtz was a universal genius,\nan artist, musician, journalist, politician, and so on, his chief characteris-\ntic was his gift of language: \"A voice! a voice! It was grave, profound,\nvibrating, while the man did not seem capable of a whisper. . . . Kurtz\ndiscoursed. A voice! a voice! It rang deep to the very last. It survived his\nstrength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the barren darkness\nof his heart\" (77, 85). Kurtz, in short (a pun there on Kurtz's name, which\nmeans \"short\" in German; Marlow makes a similar joke [76]), has a mag-\nnificent mastery of language that is similar to Marlow's own, or to Con-\nrad's. \"An appeal to me in this fiendish row\u2014is there? Very well; I hear;\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n133\nI admit, but I have a voice too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that\ncannot be silenced\" (52).\nWhat does Kurtz talk or write about? The reader is told of the lofty\nidealism of the pamphlet on the Suppression of Savage Customs. Kurtz\nhas bewitched the particolored Russian, as Marlow ironically attests, by\n\"splendid monologues on, what was it? on love, justice, conduct of life\u2014\nor what not\" (75). Most of all, however, Kurtz's discourse is dominated\nby unfulfilled and perhaps unfulfillable promises made to the whole\nworld on behalf of Eurocentric imperialist capitalism and in support of\nhis role own as its embodiment: \"All Europe contributed to the making of\nKurtz\" (66). Kurtz is like a John the Baptist announcing the new capitalist\nmessiah, or perhaps is himself that self-proclaimed messiah. That his be-\ntrothed is called \"the Intended\" is the emblem of this future-oriented,\nproleptic feature of Kurtz's eloquence. \"I had immense plans,\" he \"mut-\nters,\" when Marlow is trying to persuade him come back to the boat. \"I\nwas on the threshold of great things\" (82). Later, as he lies dying on the\nship that is taking him back toward Europe, his \"discourse\" is all future-\noriented, all promises of great things to come: \"The wastes of his weary\nbrain were haunted by shadowy images now\u2014images of wealth and fame\nrevolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble and lofty\nexpression. My Intended, my station, my career, my ideas\u2014these were\nthe subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated sentiments\" (85).\nThe fulfillment of these promises is cut short by a death that seals a\nsecret or \"mystery\" that Kurtz carries with him to the grave. This secret\nis the necessary accompaniment of his grandiose promises. In being in-\nhabited by this mystery, Kurtz is the embodiment not just of European\ncapitalist imperialism's ideology but also of its dark shadow, a ghost that\ncannot be laid, the \"it\" that is the inevitable accompaniment of imperial-\nism. Marlow identifies this \"it,\" in figure, both with Kurtz and with the\n\"wilderness\" that has invaded his soul. Since Kurtz embodies the dark-\nness, when it has invaded his hollowness, it is logical that he himself\nshould become the \"god\" that the Africans worship and crawl before.\nThis strikingly anticipates the fascist or violent authoritarian possibilities\nwithin capitalist imperialism. Kurtz's soul, like the \"it,\" is \"an inconceiv-\nable mystery\" (83). He has \"a smile of indefinable meaning\" (84). \"His\nwas an impenetrable darkness\" (86). Marlow's allegiance to Kurtz and\nthrough Kurtz to the wilderness makes him feel as if he too were \"buried\nin a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets\" (79), just as the African\nwoman matches the wilderness in having \"an air of brooding over an\ninscrutable purpose\" (77). The forest has an \"air of hidden knowledge, of\npatient expectation, of unapproachable silence\" (72). It was \"the stillness\nof an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention\" (49).\n\n\n134 \nCHAPTER FIVE\nThese words\u2014\"unspeakable,\" \"inscrutable,\" \"unapproachable\"\u2014must\nbe taken literally. Kurtz in his actions and words is no more able to re-\nmove the last veil in an ultimate revelation than Marlow or Conrad can\nin their narrations. In all three cases a promise is made whose fulfillment\nor definitive nonfulfillment always remains yet to come.\nWhat can one say to explain this contradiction: that Kurtz's magnifi-\ncent idealistic eloquence is at the same time inhabited by an impenetrable\ndarkness? Both Mar \nlow's narration and Kurtz's eloquence, since both are\nbased on that special speech act called a promise, are subject to two in-\neluctable features of any promise: (1) A promise would not be a promise\nbut rather a constative statement of foreknowledge if it were not possible\nthat the promise will not be kept. A possible nonfulfillment is an inalien-\nable structural feature of any promise, whether made in literature or in\npolitics. (2) Any promise is an invocation of an unknown and unknow-\nable future, of a secret other that remains secret and is invited to come\ninto the hollow uncertainty of the promise.\nIn the case of Marlow's narration, which I claim is an exemplary liter-\nary work, what enters the narration is all that talk of the inscrutable, the\nimpenetrable mystery, the unspeakable secret, and so on, that has so of-\nfended some of Conrad's readers. In Kurtz's case the millennial promise\nmade by imperialist capitalism, since it is hollow at the core, cannot be\nseparated from the possibility, or perhaps even the necessity, of invasion\nby the \"it,\" what Conrad calls the \"heart of darkness.\" Kurtz's case is\nexemplary of that. It is a parable or allegory of this necessity. No imperi-\nalist capitalism without the darkness. They go together. Nor has that\nspectral accompaniment of capitalism's millennial promise of worldwide\npeace, prosperity, and universal democracy by any means disappeared\ntoday. Today the imperialist exploitation of Conrad's day and its accom-\npanying philanthropic idealism have been replaced, as I have said, by the\nUtopian promises made for the new global economy and the new regime\nof telecommunications, but injustice, inequality, poverty, and bloody eth-\nnic conflicts continue all over the world.\nAs Jacques Derrida and Werner Hamacher have recognized, the politi-\ncal left and the political right are consonant in the promises they make.\nThe promise of universal prosperity made for the new economy domi-\nnated by science and transformative communications techniques echoes\nthe messianic promise, a messianism without messiah, of classical Marx-\nism. It also echoes the promises made by right-wing ideologies, even the\nmost unspeakably brutal, for example the Nazi promise of a thousand-\nyear Reich. We are inundated, swamped, and engulfed every day by the\npresent form of those promises\u2014in newspapers and magazines, on tele-\nvision, in advertising, on the Internet, in political and policy pronounce-\nments. All these promise that everything will get bigger, faster, better,\n\n\nCONRAD: HEART OF DARKNESS \n135\nmore \"user-friendly,\" and lead to worldwide prosperity. These promises\nare all made by language or other signs, \"the gift of expression, the bewil-\ndering, the illuminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the\npulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an im-\npenetrable darkness\" (63).\nI return to my beginning. Should we, ought we to, read Heart of Dark-\nness} Each reader must decide that for himself or herself. There are cer-\ntainly ways to read Heart of Darkness that might do harm. If it is read,\nhowever, as I believe it should be read, that is, as a powerful exemplary\nrevelation of the ideology of capitalist imperialism, including its racism\nand sexism, as that ideology is consonant with a certain definition of\nliterature that is its concomitant, including the presence in both capital-\nism and literature of a nonrevelatory revelation or the invocation of a\nnonrevealable secret, then, I declare, Heart of Darkness should be read. It\nought to be read. There is an obligation to do so.\nNOTES\n1. Paul Celan, \"Aschenglorie (Ashglory),\" in Breathturn, trans. Pierre Joris,\nbilingual ed.

The \"original\" (but what is more problematic than this concept of an origi-\nnal base for a \nfictional \nwork?) of the framing scene was, if Ford Madox Ford is to\nbe believed, Conrad's residence in Stamford-le-Hope in Essex from September\n1896 to September 1898. There he knew various businessmen who did indeed\ntake weekend cruises on a yawl. \"[H]e was still quivering,\" says Ford, \"with his\nattempt, with the aid of the Director, the Lawyer, and the Accountant, to float a\ndiamond mine in South Africa. For Conrad had his adventures of that sort, too\u2014\nadventures ending naturally in frustration. . . . while waiting for that financial\nflotation to mature, he floated physically during week-ends in the company of\nthose financiers on the bosom of that tranquil waterway [the Thames]\" (Joseph\nConrad, Heart of Darkness: An Authoritative Text; Backgrounds and Sources;\nEssays in Criticism, ed.

Nothing is said about this in the story itself, and Marlow, the reader must\nalways remember, must be kept strictly separate from Conrad himself, as separate\nas the narrator of \"The Secret Sharer\" must be kept from his ghostly double.\nFord's testimony, however, shows that Conrad himself was complicit, or wanted\nto be complicit, if he could have raised the money for it, in an exploitative imperi-\nalist enterprise that is not so different from Leopold IPs merciless and murderous\nexploitation of the Congo or from Kurtz's raiding the country for ivory.

Erin Albright paused a moment in the madness to take it all in. The slash and crash of music designed to get your ass moving had those asses crowding the dance floor. Lights shifting from steamy red to electric blue to hot pink made it all so frigging sexy! The bartender\u2019s generous pours on tonight\u2019s signature drink, Girl Power, didn\u2019t hurt a thing. They\u2019d chosen a Monday night at the Down and Dirty because they\u2019d wanted the heat, the sexy, and an off night so they\u2019d have plenty of room for the couple dozen friends they\u2019d wanted to join in the celebration. Plus, Monday nights at the D&D meant holo-bands, so people could jump on the stage and join right in. And when they did, it added to the fun. Shauna jumped up onstage\u2014again\u2014and someone made the mistake of giving her a mic. Shauna had a voice like a cat in heat, and she used it to screech out the lyrics to \u201cBang Me Hard.\u201d God, could she possibly be more adorable? And in five days, only five more days, Erin thought, on August 20, 2061, she\u2019ll be my wife, and I\u2019ll be hers. Together forever. At five-two, Shauna Hunnicut made Erin think of a sexy fairy, one with a wild tangle of red hair and big, beautiful blue eyes. And that smile? Another killer. The hair had caught her eye that first time, and the eyes had dazzled. But oh, that smile. It had simply done her in from the get-go. She\u2019d walked into Fancy Feet for a pair of shoes, and walked out completely infatuated. She, the no-strings, live-life-for-today street artist had fallen, and hard, for the shoe store manager. Who\u2019d have thought that fifteen months, three weeks, and two days later, they\u2019d promise each other lifetimes? She couldn\u2019t wait to make that promise, to hear Shauna make it to her. Shauna\u2019s friend Becca\u2014her friend, too, now\u2014grabbed Erin\u2019s hand. \u201cGotta shake it, baby!\u201d She shook it with Becca on the dance floor, and like everyone else, joined in on the chorus. \u201cBang me, bang me harder. Oh! Bang me, bang me harder. Oh. Oh. Oh!\u201d \u201cThis is so much fun!\u201d Becca shouted, and shoved her swing of strawberry blond\u2014now sweaty\u2014hair back from her pretty face. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I ever been here before?\u201d \u201cBecause it\u2019s a sex club and you\u2019re an upstanding young professional and executive at a stuffy Madison Avenue marketing firm?\u201d \u201cJunior executive at a stuffy Madison Avenue marketing firm.\u201d Becca executed a spin. \u201cWoo! And I might not be so upstanding after tonight! You and Shauna have to get married more often!\u201d \u201cOne and done for me.\u201d She looked back as Shauna wound up for the finish. \u201cGod, isn\u2019t she cute? Is anybody more adorable than my soon-to-be wife?\u201d \u201cLoved her for years\u2014in a straight-girl kind of way. I\u2019m so happy for her. For you, too!\u201d A little bit drunk, and sweaty with it, Becca wrapped her arms around Erin. Cheers erupted. Erin added her own as Shauna threw her hands in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get my girl before she decides to do an encore.\u201d Waving her own hands in the air, Erin wove her way through bodies to the stage. \u201cCome down and dance with me, you sexy thing!\u201d \u201cAnytime, anywhere.\u201d Face glowing, Shauna dropped down to her butt, then scooted the rest of the way off the stage. \u201cThis is so much fun!\u201d In her tiny blue dress and mile-high heels, she wrapped around Erin. \u201cYou have the best ideas.\u201d \u201cMy best idea ever was deciding to try on those wild pink shoes I saw in the window. Pink shoes led me to you. I love you, baby.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest woman in this club, in this city, possibly the world. Because I have you.\u201d Swaying to the music, wrapped tight, they kissed. Soft, sweet, even as music boomed out a frantic beat. Who knew, Erin thought again. Who knew she\u2019d find the woman of her dreams\u2014dreams she hadn\u2019t thought to dream? A woman who\u2019d open her life to love, to plans, to the future. Everything before Shauna had been the now. Always just the right now, forget tomorrow. Now she loved, and wanted thousands of tomorrows. So they danced, then danced some more as a couple, in groups. More cheers blasted as the next holo-band stripped down to G-strings. Becca rushed the stage, stripped off her short, slinky dress, and danced. More cheers. \u201cWe\u2019ve corrupted her.\u201d Eyes full of delight, Shauna laughed. \u201cShe was the poster girl of straitlaced in high school. A complete doof. Now she\u2019s drunk and dancing in her underwear in a sex club.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty underwear.\u201d On another laugh, Shauna gave Erin another kiss. \u201cBuy me a drink, gorgeous.\u201d \u201cYou got it.\u201d They made their way to the bar tended by the owner. Crack, a big, muscular, tattooed Black man, wore a leather vest over his bare chest. He shot them a wide grin. \u201cAnother round, brides-to-be?\u201d \u201cGirl Power!\u201d Shauna shouted, pumping fists in the air. \u201cYou got that going.\u201d He mixed drinks with his big, experienced hands. \u201cBrought me a wild bunch tonight.\u201d \u201cMore than a few out there would go for a handsome kick-ass dude like you,\u201d Erin told him. \u201cGot me a one-in-ten-million woman be waiting when I get home.\u201d \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t know you had a serious going on.\u201d \u201cAin\u2019t been in my place for a while, have you?\u201d \u201cI guess not.\u201d Erin tipped her purple-streaked shaggy blond bob to Shauna\u2019s mass of red. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got my own one in ten million now.\u201d \u201cAw.\u201d Shauna kissed her again. \u201cBut we\u2019re coming back, bunches, because I love this place. I thought we\u2019d get all glammed up and go to an upscale bar and \u2026 I didn\u2019t mean your place isn\u2019t upscale.\u201d He sent her a wicked flash of a grin. \u201cHoney, it ain\u2019t the Down and Dirty for nothing. Now, if any of the chicks and slicks in my place hassle any of your group how you don\u2019t want to be hassled, you let me know and\u2014\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll crack their heads together,\u201d Erin finished. \u201cIt\u2019s how he got his name.\u201d \u201cFor serious?\u201d Face fierce, Crack made a head-banging gesture with his hands. \u201cWe don\u2019t be upscale, but we got standards.\u201d He slid the drinks toward them. \u201cDrink up. This round\u2019s on me.\u201d Shauna toasted him, then drank a third of the glass in one go. \u201cGod, this is so good, and I\u2019m going to get so wasted. Let\u2019s dance some of this buzz off!\u201d Within twenty minutes, Shauna jumped back onstage to scream out another song, and this time stripped down like Becca. Astonished in the best possible way, Erin watched her shimmy and shake. A couple others, inspired, climbed up to join in. Erin checked the time and, pleased she\u2019d estimated when the party would hit peak, sent a text, smiled at the response. Then slipped away from the dance floor. She\u2019d planned this surprise, a winner, every detail, including that timing. Her accomplice would be waiting in the privacy room she\u2019d rented. She intended to make her bride\u2019s every dream come true, starting now. The love of her life\u2019s dream? Hawaii. She\u2019d worked her ass off to sell enough paintings to afford the trip\u2014something they\u2019d started saving for, for later. This time? Forget later. Now would shine. She\u2019d kept this secret for nearly three weeks\u2014and that hadn\u2019t been easy for her. But she\u2019d let Shauna think they\u2019d hold off on that dream honeymoon for a year, maybe two, as they\u2019d agreed. Even her trusted accomplice\u2014actually, her backup accomplice\u2014didn\u2019t know. She\u2019d just needed someone to smuggle in her overnight case holding the grass skirt, coconut bra, leis, and the crazy pink shoes that had started it all. And those tickets to Maui. Once she\u2019d changed, she\u2019d take the stage! She headed toward the back. The privacy rooms weren\u2019t a hot ticket on a Monday night\u2014she knew from previous experience. Dimmer lights, soundproofed doors offered an option for those who wanted a quick round between drinks. She didn\u2019t regret that her days of those quick rounds had passed. She\u2019d already slipped her accomplice the swipe, so pressed the buzzer that would flicker the lights inside. The door opened, and she entered the darkened room. \u201cReally appreciate this,\u201d she said as she walked in, then turned to close the door so the privacy locks clicked behind her. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a clue! Oh, she\u2019s going to go crazy! I\u2019m going to need more light to\u2014\u201d Something thin and sharp circled her neck, cutting off her air. Blood dribbled down her throat as it broke through the skin. She flailed, tried to scream, struggled to drag the wire away. When her head slammed against the door, she saw stars. As the wire cut deeper, the stars went out. The communicator woke her out of a dead sleep. Lieutenant Eve Dallas cursed it, then pushed up in bed as her husband ordered lights at ten percent. She shoved a hand through her short, choppy brown hair, nudged at the fat cat on her other side. Galahad just rolled. \u201cDallas.\u201d Dispatch, Dallas, Lieutenant Eve. Probable homicide. Nine-one-one caller requested you. Report to \u2026 When she heard the address, Eve rolled over the cat and out of bed. \u201cThe Down and Dirty?\u201d Affirmative. \u201cName of nine-one-one caller?\u201d Wilson Buckley, identified as the owner. \u201cI\u2019m on my way, and will contact Detective Peabody. Dallas out.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m with you,\u201d Roarke said, and had already pulled on jeans. \u201cIt\u2019s Crack\u2019s place. I\u2019m with you.\u201d After a look at her face as she sprinted to her closet, he added, \u201cIf it had been Rochelle, he\u2019d have contacted you directly.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right. That sounds right.\u201d She grabbed what came to hand out of her closet. Black trousers, a white tee, a black jacket, belt, boots. As she pulled on clothes, Roarke stepped in, already dressed, with her weapon harness. \u201cThanks.\u201d She strapped it on. \u201cMonday night\u2014it\u2019s Monday night, right?\u201d \u201cJust tipped over into Tuesday morning.\u201d \u201cShould be a slow night for the D&D. That\u2019s how I met him.\u201d She rushed out to snag her badge, her \u2019link, the communicator. \u201cDB across the street from his place. Nothing to do with his place, or him, but that\u2019s how I met him. Since you\u2019re coming, you drive. I\u2019ll contact Peabody, get her ass up and moving.\u201d Other than herself, she trusted him most to drive like a wild thing all the way downtown. As they jogged downstairs, she tried not to resent that he looked as if he\u2019d had eight solid hours of sleep, probably with a massage beforehand. The impossibly blue eyes alert, that black silk mane of hair somehow perfect. He wouldn\u2019t have given a moment\u2019s thought to the clothes he\u2019d put on, and yet they looked exactly right on that tall, rangy frame. It could be a pisser to wake up after less than an hour down beside an Irish god. He\u2019d already remoted her vehicle from the garage, so it waited outside the Irish god\u2019s castle. After strapping into the passenger seat, she gave another finger swipe to her hair, then pressed the heels of her hands to her long, whiskey-colored eyes. Everything felt like a pisser, she admitted as he all but flew down the long drive to the gates that opened on his approach. Coffee would fix that. She programmed two\u2014strong and black\u2014from the in-dash AutoChef. At that first life-giving glug, some of the clouds lifted. She reminded herself she\u2019d recently had a long weekend on Roarke\u2019s private island. Just the two of them and sun, surf, sand, sex. What did she have to bitch about? Having a friend report a dead body at not quite one in the morning? Yeah, bitch-worthy, but that was the job. Plus, she got to give her partner the same treatment. She drank more coffee, let it perform its miracles, then contacted Peabody. \u201cYeah, Peabody. What?\u201d \u201cJesus, block video. I don\u2019t need to see your tits.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re quite lovely,\u201d Roarke commented, and earned the hard eye from Eve. \u201cOh, sorry, block video. We got caught up purging and packing for the Big Move. We practically just went down. Who\u2019s dead?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know the who, but the where is the Down and Dirty.\u201d Eve clearly heard McNab\u2014EDD ace and the second half of Peabody\u2019s \u201cwe\u201d\u2014curse. She supposed there were Friendship Rules just like there were Marriage Rules. She\u2019d have two detectives on scene. \u201cIs Crack okay?\u201d \u201cHe called it in. Pull it together, get there.\u201d She clicked off, gauged the speed and distance. She calculated even though Peabody and McNab lived downtown, Roarke would get there first. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have cams,\u201d Eve remembered. \u201cNo cams, in or out. Goddamn it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a sex club, Eve. You\u2019d thin out your clientele considerably with door or interior cams. And you didn\u2019t need them to deal with Casto when he attacked you at the D&D the night before our wedding.\u201d He\u2019d given her a shiner, though. She still resented it. \u201cI wonder how that corrupt asshole former cop likes prison.\u201d Despite the speed, Roarke glanced at her, smiled. \u201cI suspect not a bit.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see this being a fight gone south. Crack has a rep for dealing with trouble and troublemakers for a reason.\u201d Then she shook her head. \u201cNo point in thinking about who and why. Best to go in cold. But you know what part of the problem is?\u201d \u201cYou know too many people.\u201d She shot him a hard look. \u201cI was going to say that. How did you know I was going to say that?\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to glance over, but he did smile. \u201cI know my cop\u2019s mind.\u201d \u201cWell, I do.\u201d She chugged down the rest of her coffee. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know too many people, I\u2019d still end up driving like a maniac to a crime scene at damn near one in the morning because that\u2019s the job, but I wouldn\u2019t know so many people somehow connected if I didn\u2019t know too many people in the first place.\u201d She tipped her head back. \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d \u201cYour magnetic, people-loving personality?\u201d \u201cOh, bite me.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t I do that earlier?\u201d He had, she recalled, and in just the right way. \u201cIt\u2019s probably your fault. I don\u2019t know how exactly, but probably. And who hangs out at a downtown sex club on a Monday night?\u201d \u201cPeople lovers?\u201d he suggested. \u201cSomebody sure as hell didn\u2019t love somebody this Monday night.\u201d She spotted the police cruiser, then the uniform on the door when Roarke pulled up. A quick summer storm had rolled through about the time Roarke had been biting her in just the right way. Damp pavement and puddles gleamed in the streetlights. When she stepped out, the air steamed with August. In the steam bath, the uniform\u2019s face gleamed like the puddles. \u201cOfficer.\u201d \u201cLieutenant. Sir, my partner\u2019s inside with the DB. We received the dispatch at zero hours, sixteen minutes, and arrived on scene approximately three minutes later. Female victim, discovered by one of the staff in a privacy room. From our visual it\u2019s apparently a strangulation. Roughly eighty people inside, including staff. About two dozen of those are part of a single party. The victim was with that party, identified by others as Erin Albright.\u201d Pausing, the uniform used the back of her wrist to wipe a dribble of sweat from her temple. \u201cA hen party, sir. A girl party to celebrate an upcoming wedding. Albright was one of the brides. Crack\u2014Mr. Buckley\u2014\u201d \u201cI know Crack,\u201d Eve interrupted. \u201cThen you know he got things under control quickly. Blocked off the room, blocked the exits, even before we got on scene. He has the other bride, Shauna Hunnicut, and a couple of her friends in his office. She\u2019s upset, sir, to put it mildly.\u201d \u201cGot it. My partner\u2014 Never mind, here she comes.\u201d Peabody, in pink sneakers, khakis, with her red-streaked black hair bundled back in a short tail, hustled down the sidewalk. Beside her, McNab put on his usual show in red-and-blue-striped baggies, red airboots, and a blue tee that displayed a big red heart over his bony chest. His forest of colorful hoops gleamed along his earlobe. His long\u2014currently red-streaked\u2014blond tail bounced at his back. \u201cTake the door from inside, Officer.\u201d The uniform let out a sigh of relief. \u201cThanks, Lieutenant.\u201d Eve turned to Peabody. \u201cFemale vic, found in one of the privacy rooms. About eighty people inside, a good chunk of those with a pre-wedding party deal. The girl thing.\u201d \u201cGolly, you had yours here.\u201d \u201cUnder duress. The vic was one of the brides.\u201d \u201cHarsh,\u201d said McNab. \u201cYeah, it qualifies. Crack has the other bride with a couple friends in his office. We\u2019re going to let her calm down some. McNab, since you\u2019re here, you can start getting statements, contacts and releasing. Start with anyone not connected to the party. Peabody, you start with partygoers, and I\u2019ll take the body.\u201d \u201cWhat about Crack?\u201d Peabody asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to him. One of his people found the body, so we need that conversation. Then we\u2019ll take the other bride. You and McNab start clearing the place out. Roarke can assist me with the body. We\u2019ve got no electronics except the door of the privacy room, and Roarke can take that. No cams,\u201d she muttered. She glanced up at the glowing neon proclaiming DOWN AND DIRTY. It probably would be. Inside, the temperature dropped an easy ten degrees. No problem, she thought, separating those in the party group from those who\u2019d come in for booze and boobs. She supposed Crack had separated the brides\u2019 party\u2014lots of weeping or the glazed eyes of the shocked\u2014from the just happened to be theres. Plenty of irritation, fascination, boredom on that side. The big man himself strode across the room, straight to Eve. He didn\u2019t look shocked, bored, or weepy. He looked furious. \u201cSomebody killed that girl in my place. You find who killed that girl. I knew that girl.\u201d \u201cUnderstood. We\u2019re going to do our job, starting right now. We\u2019re going to talk to you in a bit, and we need to talk to the person who found her.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got him. He\u2019s pretty goddamn shook. I mixed her and Shauna drinks. I mixed Erin a fucking drink not two hours ago. And somebody killed that girl in my place.\u201d \u201cCrack, I need to go take care of her now.\u201d He nodded, scrubbed his hands over his face. \u201cI asked for you because I knew you\u2019d take care of her. I knew all of you would take care of her. I\u2019ll show you where she is.\u201d \u201cGet started,\u201d Eve told Peabody and McNab, and followed him. It brought on a flashback where the club blasted with music, lights flashing. Still-in-uniform Peabody gloriously drunk, pre-Oscar-win-and-bestseller-status Nadine Furst doing a striptease onstage. The shock of seeing the elegant Dr. Mira shaking her ass on the dance floor. It would\u2019ve been along those lines, Eve thought. Noisy, pretty drunk, happy women, shaking asses, bouncing around. Why had one of the brides gone into a privacy room? Lured in, she wondered, as she herself had been by someone she\u2019d considered\u2014not a friend, in her case\u2014but a colleague? \u201cWho rented the room?\u201d \u201cShe did\u2014added it on when she booked the party like two, maybe three weeks ago. Between that,\u201d he decided. \u201cDon\u2019t know why, but she said she had a surprise deal for Shauna, and not to tell anyone she had the room. I let her have it for the whole night. Mondays are slow.\u201d And wouldn\u2019t you know it, she thought when they turned down the dim corridor. The same damn privacy room. Crack handed her a swipe. \u201cThat\u2019s my master. Hers is in there, on the floor.\u201d \u201cYou go take care of your people. We\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here when you want me.\u201d She waited until he\u2019d walked away, turned her recorder on, then swiped open the door. The victim lay on her back, brown eyes staring at the ceiling. Blood from the neck wound had run down her throat to soak the bodice of a short, shiny green dress. One of her shoes had slipped off, and one arm lay outstretched. The swipe card swam in a pool of her blood just beyond her fingers. One of those tiny, useless handbags lay open on her other side. \u201cSeal up,\u201d she told Roarke. He\u2019d already opened her field kit, and handed her the can of sealant. \u201cYou first.\u201d \u201cNo jewelry,\u201d she noted as she coated her hands, her boots. \u201cSomebody wanted us to say robbery. Somebody thinks we\u2019re stupid.\u201d She handed him the sealant, took the field kit, then stepped around the blood to the body. \u201cShe\u2019s got a fresh wound on her forehead, and blood on the inside of the door\u2014that\u2019s going to be from that. So the killer was inside the room. Prepared to kill.\u201d \u201cBecause?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why yet, but that\u2019s a thin wound on her neck, and a deep one. Piano wire, maybe. Some sort of garrote. You don\u2019t have that handy if you\u2019re looking to mug. You\u2019ve got a sticker maybe, a stunner, a sap. Fresh manicure,\u201d she added as she crouched. \u201cBut two of her nails are broken, scratches on her neck where she tried to drag the wire away.\u201d Eve lifted one of the victim\u2019s hands. \u201cSkin and blood under the nails. That\u2019s going to be hers, too. Took her from behind, that\u2019s how you do it. Whip the wire around and pull, give her a good knock against the door to daze her. She\u2019d have been drinking on top of it. Party time, happy time. So reflexes are slower than sober.\u201d She glanced up at Roarke. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been drinking when Casto went for me in here because, hey, getting married the next day. That was his mistake.\u201d \u201cIn this room?\u201d \u201cYeah. Ten bucks says Peabody\u2019s going to talk about white saging it.\u201d She took a sample of the matter under Erin\u2019s nails, sealed it, labeled it. Then pressed a finger to her Identi-pad. \u201cVictim is identified as Erin Albright, age twenty-seven, mixed-race female, resides on Twelfth Street\u2014only a few blocks from here\u2014with cohab Shauna Hunnicut.\u201d She bagged both hands. \u201cMaybe she got a piece of him. Doubtful, but maybe.\u201d Before she reached in her kit for microgoggles, Roarke handed them to her. Fitting them on, she leaned close to the neck wound. \u201cYeah, some sort of wire. Piano wire, steel guitar string, what\u2019s it\u2014baling wire. Victim was garroted, with force.\u201d She took out gauges. \u201cEnough force the neck wound is a sixth of an inch deep at its deepest point. The forehead wound is fresh, a strike against the inside of the door, again with some force, but not a killing blow.\u201d As she replaced gauges, took out others, she scanned the body. \u201cThe victim is five foot five. From the angle of the wound, the killer was several inches taller, pulling back and up on the wire. ME to confirm. \u201cTime of death, twenty-three-forty-six.\u201d Eve sat back on her heels. \u201cCrack called it in at sixteen past midnight. Take a few minutes off for the one who found her to send up the alarm\u2014and Crack\u2019s going to come back here and check to be sure. So nobody missed her for a good twenty minutes or more. That gave her killer some room. See what\u2019s in her purse, will you?\u201d He walked around the body, crouched down as Eve was. \u201cLip dye, breath mints, her ID, and \u2026 three swipes in a swipe case.\u201d \u201cNo \u2019link, no cash or credits.\u201d Eve nodded. \u201cStaging it.\u201d Rising, she crossed over to open a black, top-handle case on the bed. \u201cOkay, this is weird. Is this a grass skirt?\u201d Roarke straightened and turned as she held it up. \u201cIt certainly appears to be.\u201d \u201cAnd there\u2019s one of those boob deals out of half coconuts, those flower necklaces\u2014two of them. A pair of pink heels, glittery, butterflies on the straps. Wait, something else. A card.\u201d Eve loosened the flap, slid it out. \u201cGot a scan of two tickets to Maui, leaving on Sunday. And the card reads: \u2018I want to spend a lifetime making your dreams come true. This is just the beginning. I love you, Erin.\u2019\u201d She slipped the card and contents back in the envelope. \u201cShe wanted the room so she could change into this getup. The shoes mean something\u2014I\u2019ll find out what\u2014but the rest is clear enough.\u201d Frowning, she studied the black overnight. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he take the bag? Doesn\u2019t even open it to see what was in it? Because he already knew. Either he didn\u2019t care, or panicked after the kill and forgot.\u201d She paced around the body and the blood. \u201cHow did he get in? Did she let him in? Why would she? A friend, a colleague. \u2018Great, you can help me change for the big surprise.\u2019 \u201cBut I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. Look at the position of the body, the blood on the door. He was in here, already in here. How did he get in here?\u201d \u201cI took a look at the locks while you tended to her. I don\u2019t see any sign of tampering.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, he might have followed her, come in after. But not by force. She would\u2019ve let him\u2014or her\u2014in, so that\u2019s trust. But the whole thing reads like her killer was already in the room.\u201d \u201cSomeone had to bring the bag.\u201d \u201cYeah, and if she didn\u2019t bring it in herself, her killer did. Something else to find out.\u201d She pulled out her \u2019link. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the morgue and the sweepers. Then we\u2019ll start finding out.\u201d \n Chapter Two When she went out, she saw McNab had cleared most of his side. \u201cSome Monday night regulars,\u201d McNab told her. \u201cThey come in on a slow night for the boobies and brew, maybe try to get lucky. Crack verified. A table of tourists from Topeka, doing some club-hopping. Came in because of the name. They were pretty trashed, and their story checked. Working my way through, hit on a few hard cases, but nobody rings.\u201d \u201cAll right. Finish it out.\u201d She signaled Peabody. As she walked to Eve, Peabody\u2019s sympathetic face went to cop face. \u201cThey\u2019re a mess, Dallas. They\u2019re all either friends of one bride or the other, most of them both. None of them, so far, knew anything about a privacy room, and nobody noticed the victim leaving the club area. Some of them, including the other bride, were onstage with the holo-band. A lot of them stripped down to their underwear\u2014or less. According to the statements I\u2019ve taken, they\u2019d taken over the dance floor. Some not with the group came up, joined in. No problems. One guy even bought a round of drinks, but he left.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cClosest we\u2019ve got is about midnight, maybe a little before that. He got some \u2019link numbers. Wade\u2014no last name. Tall, blond, tanned, built.\u201d \u201cTOD\u2019s twenty-three-forty-six, so that\u2019s cutting it close. But I want to know if he contacts any of them. I\u2019ll see if Crack knows him. Dead wagon and sweepers on the way. Why aren\u2019t any of them leaving?\u201d \u201cSolidarity. They stay until they all can go. And they wait for Shauna. It\u2019s a nice group of women, Dallas.\u201d \u201cNice people kill, too.\u201d She crossed to the bar where Crack stood waiting. Fury still vibrated. \u201cHanding out Sober-Up, water, coffee.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll clear them out as soon as we can.\u201d \u201cShit, it ain\u2019t that, skinny white girl. We get trouble in here sometimes. I crack heads, kick some asses. You get people puking, passing out.\u201d He shrugged that off. \u201cHad a guy last month\u2014had to be ninety\u2014shaking it like a kid out on the dance floor till he drops with a goddamn heart attack. Got the MTs in quick, but Siri\u2014she\u2019s working her way through medical school\u2014already had him back when they got here. \u201cNobody ever died in my place. Nobody ever got murdered. I keep an eye, try to keep a good eye, but I didn\u2019t see her leave. Didn\u2019t notice how long she was gone. Mondays are slow, and we usually close down by one. Hell, I don\u2019t usually take the stick on Mondays, but I knew Erin, and I wanted to be here, make sure it went smooth for her. The way the girls were going, I figured we\u2019d give them till two, so I texted Ro, just so she\u2019d know I\u2019d be home later than usual. I figured she\u2019d be sleeping, but she was up. So I was texting with my lady, and I didn\u2019t keep a good eye.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something while you make me some of that bullshit you call coffee in here.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t drink that swill, girl. I got Pepsi.\u201d \u201cBetter. I\u2019m going to tell you whoever did this wouldn\u2019t have looked threatening, wouldn\u2019t have stood out to your good eye. My first instinct is Erin knew them.\u201d Crack\u2019s gaze skimmed over the partygoers. \u201cNot one of these girls. No fucking way.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s always a way, but I don\u2019t know yet. Who else knew about the room?\u201d \u201cJust me, far as I know.\u201d He put a tube of Pepsi on the bar. \u201cShe was real insistent on that.\u201d \u201cYou gave her the swipe.\u201d \u201cYeah, she came in right around noon, picked it up. Said it was real cloak-and-dagger stuff. She was so fucking happy. The happy just bounced off her.\u201d \u201cDid she come alone?\u201d \u201cYeah, just Erin. And in and out, like she had an appointment.\u201d \u201cHow about tonight? Did she come in by herself?\u201d \u201cNo, her and Shauna together, and a couple of others right behind them.\u201d \u201cDid she have a case, like a small overnight bag?\u201d Eve held out her hands to indicate size. \u201cA black case.\u201d \u201cI saw that, that case on the bed. No. She wasn\u2019t carrying it, or anything but that little purse.\u201d \u201cDid you notice her go out at any point?\u201d \u201cOutside.\u201d He frowned, rubbed at his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t think so. She and Shauna got here early, maybe nine-thirty. Most come in closer to ten, or some after.\u201d \u201cYou had to take a break or two. You don\u2019t work the stick straight through.\u201d \u201cTook fifteen about ten-thirty maybe, gave it over to Renee. Shit, she\u2019s good on the bar, but doesn\u2019t have a sharp eye, not so much.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to her, and to the one who found Erin.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s Pete. I got him calmed down some. You want a room?\u201d \u201cNo, here\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get Renee first, give him a little more calm time. Get you something?\u201d he asked Roarke. \u201cI\u2019m good. He\u2019ll carry this,\u201d Roarke added when Crack walked away. \u201cThinking he should\u2019ve seen something.\u201d \u201cI can wish he had, but it\u2019s not on him.\u201d A woman came out, dark skin, red lips, some fear in her eyes. And built, like all of the staff. \u201cI\u2019m Renee. Crack said you needed to talk to me.\u201d \u201cYou were tending bar when Crack took his break.\u201d \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d She pushed a hand over a cap of rainbow-colored hair. \u201cHe had me relieve him, I don\u2019t know, about ten-thirty. Thereabouts.\u201d \u201cDid you notice anyone leaving, or coming in when you were on the stick?\u201d \u201cUm. Um.\u201d \u201cThose are lovely earrings,\u201d Roarke commented. Some of the fear died away as she lifted a hand to one of the fist-sized silver stars. \u201cThanks. They\u2019re my favorite. Erin\u2014 Oh God.\u201d Fear trickled back as she put a hand to those red lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know her, except tonight. I started working here a couple months ago, but Crack said we should make sure the brides got whatever they wanted. So she came up to the bar with her empty glass. She said like, hit me again, and how I should tell Shauna, if she asked, she went to the ladies\u2019. And gave me a wink.\u201d \u201cDid she?\u201d \u201cYeah, I guess. But just a few minutes.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cUm, right after I took the stick. I mixed her drink, had it waiting. She came back\u2014just a few minutes\u2014and\u2014and\u2014she looked so happy.\u201d \u201cDid you notice anyone come in during that time, when she came back?\u201d \u201cNo, but \u2026 Crack says to keep an eye, but\u2014the ladies were having so much fun. Some of them onstage, half-naked, singing, dancing. On the floor, dancing with each other. I was watching them because they were having so much fun, and they weren\u2019t like our usuals.\u201d \u201cDid you see anyone with a black case, about this big? Black with a handle on the top?\u201d \u201cNo, ma\u2019am, I sure didn\u2019t.\u201d Considering the damp fear in those eyes, Eve let the ma\u2019am slide. \u201cOkay. I appreciate it. I\u2019d like to speak with Pete.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s with Crack, I\u2019ll tell Crack. Can I go home? It\u2019s just, my mom\u2019s watching my little boy, and I didn\u2019t want to tell her what happened. I get home by one on Mondays.\u201d \u201cYeah, you can go. \u201cDoor, back door,\u201d Eve murmured. \u201cJohn\u2019s down that way. She could\u2019ve let someone in the back, whoever brought the case. Doesn\u2019t want anyone looking for her. Give them the swipe so they can put the case in the room.\u201d \u201cAnd her killer goes straight there, inside.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one way. Odds are good nobody sees them. After it\u2019s done, go out the same way. In and out the back. No cams to worry about.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go check the door?\u201d \u201cDo that. I\u2019ll have the sweepers check for prints. They couldn\u2019t be stupid enough to leave any, but we\u2019ll check.\u201d As Roarke headed off, Crack came out again, this time with a man in a tight, sleeveless black tee that showed off impressive biceps. Eve gauged him as early twenties, currently pale as a summer cloud. His curling mass of bronze hair framed a chiseled, square-jawed face. He shook like a leaf in a windstorm. \u201cPete, why don\u2019t you go around and sit down there by Dallas. Lieutenant Dallas,\u201d Crack corrected. \u201cOkay. Okay, but can you stick with me?\u201d Eve gave Crack a nod. With his arm around Pete\u2019s muscled shoulders, Crack led him around the bar. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what happened?\u201d Eve began. \u201cI found her. I served her drinks earlier. They had a table, and she and the other\u2014the one getting married\u2014they danced on the table. Then I found her.\u201d \u201cHow long after you served the drinks before you found her?\u201d \u201cOh. I don\u2019t know exactly. An hour? Maybe more.\u201d \u201cIt was just some after midnight when you took your break,\u201d Crack prompted. \u201cRight, right. Okay.\u201d Pressing his fingers to his eyes, Pete rubbed. \u201cCrack said I could use one of the privacy rooms to crash for thirty. I\u2019m taking some summer classes, going for my MBA. It\u2019s finals week, and I\u2019ve been cramming it. I guess it showed. Sorry.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t hand me that bullshit. He needed a break,\u201d Crack said to Eve. \u201cI told him to take thirty, gave him a swipe. We only had the one room booked anyway.\u201d \u201cGot it. So shortly after midnight, you went back to crash for thirty.\u201d \u201cYeah. Set the alarm on my \u2019link. I can show you.\u201d \u201cNo need. And when you went into the privacy area?\u201d \u201cOkay, I was walking by, and I saw the room\u2014not mine, the one a couple up from it\u2014wasn\u2019t locked. See, Crack wants the privacy rooms locked, occupied or not, right? We don\u2019t want anybody sliding in one of them without paying. Or if someone\u2019s using one, the door has to be secured or it\u2019s a violation.\u201d \u201cBut this door wasn\u2019t secured.\u201d \u201cNo. The green light was on\u2014that\u2019s open. So I pushed the door open and\u2014\u201d \u201cYou pushed the door open? It wasn\u2019t closed all the way.\u201d \u201cI\u2026\u201d Frowning, he rubbed his eyes again. \u201cUm, wait. I was heading down, I saw the green light, and I \u2026 Yeah, yeah, I just pushed on the door. It wasn\u2019t all the way closed. I didn\u2019t say that before. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t think of it. I\u2014\u201d \u201cPete.\u201d Eve put a hand on the solid wall of his arm. \u201cTake a breath. You\u2019re doing fine. You pushed open the door.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t tell the other cop that. I didn\u2019t think about it, but yeah. I just gave it a little nudge. And she was \u2026 God, God, there was so much blood. I\u2019ve never seen that much blood, not for real.\u201d His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed when he swallowed. \u201cAnd she was just lying there in all the blood. I couldn\u2019t stop staring, then things went sort of gray. I pulled the door closed. I didn\u2019t want anyone to see that. I\u2019m always going to see that, all the blood, and her lying in it. I pulled the door closed, and I went and got Crack. \u201cI fucked up. I didn\u2019t handle it like I should. I left her lying in all the blood.\u201d \u201cYou handled it exactly right,\u201d Eve corrected. He gave her a pitifully hopeful look. \u201cI did?\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019d gone in, you\u2019d have compromised the scene, made it harder for us to find who did that to her. You closed the door, and if you hadn\u2019t, maybe someone else would\u2019ve gone in. You got help. You did exactly the right thing.\u201d He covered his face with his hands. \u201cI kind of knew her. She used to come in a couple times a month. Not lately, not for a while, I guess. But she used to, so I kind of knew her.\u201d \u201cHow long have you worked here, Pete?\u201d \u201cA few years. Almost three.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a sense. Did you notice anybody paying too much attention to her?\u201d \u201cNot the wrong kind. She\u2014all of them\u2014were really bashing it, so other customers watched some. And some of them got up and joined in. It\u2019s like contagious, you know? The energy. It seemed like the ladies in the group weren\u2019t interested in hooking up tonight, right?\u201d \u201cSomeone mentioned a man named Wade got some of their contacts.\u201d \u201cYeah, well, Wade would.\u201d He said it with his first shaky smile. \u201cHe\u2019s a player,\u201d Crack told her. \u201cComes in most every week, targets some of the ladies. Goes smooth, not pushy.\u201d \u201cGot a last name? We need to check all the boxes.\u201d \u201cI can get it. He always runs a tab.\u201d \u201cOkay. Pete, when you went back for your break, when you pushed open the door, did you see anyone, or anything that seemed off besides the unsecured door?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything but her. Swear to God. All I could see was her.\u201d \u201cAll right. If you think of anything else, you can contact me. You\u2019ve been very helpful.\u201d \u201cYou go on home now, Pete.\u201d Crack patted his back. \u201cYou take yourself another soother or whatever you need, and get some sleep.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll see her in my sleep.\u201d \u201cYou saw her dancing on the table,\u201d Eve reminded him. \u201cPut that in front. See her like that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d Crack waited until Pete walked out. \u201cGonna mess him up for a while, but he\u2019ll get through it. I\u2019ll get you Wade\u2019s name and all, but I\u2019m saying he\u2019s a player, smooth with it, and sex is his game. Don\u2019t see him killing anybody.\u201d \u201cHave to check those boxes.\u201d \u201cGot that. You want Shauna now?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go to her, but I want Peabody with me. One thing. You\u2019ve got a back exit. People can get in that way. No security there?\u201d Crack shrugged. \u201cWe got no cover. Make the scratch on the drinks, privacy tables, and rooms. I don\u2019t care how people come in, as long as they cough up the scratch. When we\u2019ve got live music and a slamming crowd, Big Tiny and I rotate off the door to bounce any assholes out. I don\u2019t bring him in on slow nights.\u201d \u201cOne more. No monitor for unsecured privacy doors?\u201d Now he sighed. \u201cI got the e\u2019s for that right under the bar, and another in my office. I missed it. Texting with Ro, maybe. If I\u2019d caught it, I\u2019d\u2019ve gone back and spared that boy the trauma. \u201cYou think he came in the back?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my most probable at this time.\u201d \u201cFuck it. I guess I gotta break down and put a cam on the back door.\u201d He glanced over. \u201cI guess he\u2019s the one to ask about it.\u201d She turned, watched Roarke walk back to the bar. \u201cNo tampering,\u201d he said, then looked at Crack. \u201cMy friend, I know you keep the doors unsecured during club hours, but Christ Jesus, you need better security than what you have when you\u2019re closed. A toddler could get through your locks.\u201d \u201cNobody does \u2019cause they know who owns the place.\u201d His lips spread in a wide, fierce grin. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to do just that. How about you work something up for me?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d \u201cNo cams on the front. The bulk of our clientele\u2019s going to find someplace else to patronize we get cams on the front door.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t I work something up that won\u2019t show, even to that clientele.\u201d \u201cYou got something like that?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s got every-damn-thing,\u201d Eve said. \u201cYou work it up. Want me to take you back to Shauna?\u201d \u201cGive me a few.\u201d When Eve rose, walked over to Peabody, Roarke sat. \u201cAny whiskey in stock that won\u2019t burn through my esophagus?\u201d Crack smiled again. \u201cI got my private stash of the good stuff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take three fingers of that, if you\u2019ll join me.\u201d When McNab joined them, Crack lifted the bottle. \u201cWhiskey? It\u2019s the good stuff.\u201d McNab sent a longing look at the label. \u201cIt sure as hell is. The Scot in me says, \u2018Set me up, mate.\u2019 But I\u2019m a cop on duty. I don\u2019t guess you\u2019ve got any fizzies.\u201d With an owlish stare, Crack took a sip of the good stuff. \u201cBony white boy, does this place look like a fizzy bar?\u201d \u201cGinger ale maybe?\u201d \u201cI can get you that.\u201d Crack started to pour one, then paused when the morgue team came in. \u201cHell. Fucking hell. Is she going to Morris, do you know?\u201d \u201cDallas would\u2019ve asked for him.\u201d McNab took the glass. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. None of this is right.\u201d Crack came around to sit. \u201cShe\u2019ll catch who did this.\u201d Roarke nodded as Eve led the morgue team to the body. \u201cShe won\u2019t stop until she does. Get you a drink, Peabody?\u201d he asked when she came over. \u201cCold caffeine\u2014not your coffee. I want to be able to keep my stomach lining intact. Dallas is having them take the victim out the back so her friends don\u2019t have to see. They won\u2019t budge until Shauna\u2019s released. McNab, Dallas wants you to direct the sweepers when they get here.\u201d \u201cOn that. Totally on it, since here they come.\u201d \u201cSit,\u201d Roarke said to Peabody as she downed that cold caffeine. \u201cBetter not. Got another round to go.\u201d She downed more when Eve came back into the club. Eve paused a moment, had a word with the head sweeper before signaling Peabody. Crack pushed off the stool. \u201cI\u2019ll take you back. Ginger ale,\u201d he added when she took a hard look at McNab\u2019s empty glass. \u201cGo home,\u201d she told Roarke. He lifted his glass. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying some of the good stuff.\u201d \u201cWhatever. With me, Peabody.\u201d The door behind the bar led to a half-assed kitchen where they generated half-assed bar snacks. Though it shined clean, she figured if she\u2019d been trapped in a cave for a week with no food or water, she might have, just maybe might have, risked eating something not hermetically sealed from that space. A short, skinny corridor led to another door where Crack stopped. \u201cI gave her a soother earlier. Can\u2019t say if it helped much.\u201d When he opened the door, the three women huddled together on chairs he\u2019d obviously brought in from the club froze. Like hers, his office ran small, but he\u2019d managed to wedge in two more chairs. And like hers, his office space said business, not socializing. A desk, his data and communication center, a big desk chair for a big man, a mini-AC, and a speed bag. She immediately wondered if she could put a speed bag in her office. \u201cThis is Lieutenant Dallas and Detective Peabody.\u201d Crack eased over to take the middle woman\u2019s hands. \u201cThey\u2019re the best there is. I promise you that, Shauna. The best.\u201d \u201cWill they let me see her?\u201d Her voice, like her eyes, was dull. \u201cNo one will let me see her.\u201d \u201cMs. Hunnicut,\u201d Eve began, \u201cthe chief medical examiner is taking care of Erin now. There\u2019s no one who\u2019ll take better care of her. We\u2019ll arrange for you to see her tomorrow.\u201d \u201cI need to see her. I need to touch her. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cShauna, you listen to Dallas and Peabody now. I\u2019m going to be right outside, but you listen to them.\u201d \u201cCan we stay, please?\u201d The woman on the right, a pretty strawberry blonde with red-rimmed, swollen green eyes, sent a pleading look toward Eve. \u201cI\u2019m Becca\u2014Rebecca DiNuzio\u2014and that\u2019s Angie Decker. We\u2019re friends, we\u2019re all friends. Can we stay with Shauna?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Eve nodded at Crack. He gave Shauna\u2019s hands another squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m right outside.\u201d A tear trickled down Shauna\u2019s cheek as Crack stepped out. \u201cWe\u2019re getting married in just a few days. On Saturday we\u2019re getting married. This can\u2019t be real.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for your loss,\u201d Eve said as she and Peabody sat. \u201cI know this is a difficult time, but if we could ask you\u2014the three of you\u2014some questions, it\u2019ll help us find who did this to Erin.\u201d \u201cSomeone killed her. They said she\u2019s dead, but I don\u2019t understand. Why would someone kill Erin?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to find out. Can you tell me where you were, what you were doing about midnight?\u201d \u201cNobody was paying attention to the time.\u201d \u201cI kind of was.\u201d Angie, a stunning Black woman with razor-edged cheekbones and large, liquid brown eyes, slid a hand over Shauna\u2019s. \u201cI have a job tomorrow. I\u2019m a model and I have to report for hair and makeup at eight. I swore I wouldn\u2019t stay past one, so I was watching the time. And mostly drinking water. \u201cShauna and Becca were both onstage. Chloe, too, and Margo about that time.\u201d \u201cI was singing and dancing onstage when she needed me.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t know. None of us knew. How could we, sweetheart? Lieutenant, Erin was my best friend in the world. I was standing up for her like Becca for Shauna.\u201d Angie turned to Shauna. \u201cYou\u2019d just come down, and you started looking for her. You asked me if I\u2019d seen her, but I hadn\u2019t, not since we came back from the bathroom about an hour before.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d Eve interrupted. \u201cYou and Erin went to the john about eleven?\u201d \u201cMore like ten-thirty. I saw her heading that way, so headed out and joined her. We made a deal about going to the ladies\u2019 in pairs or groups. She thought I was being silly when I caught up with her, but that was the deal.\u201d \u201cWhat then?\u201d \u201cThen?\u201d Angie frowned. \u201cWell, we used the bathroom, then she said she had a drink waiting at the bar, and she went to the bar. I took one of the tables.\u201d She turned to Shauna again. \u201cYou asked if I\u2019d seen her as soon as you came down from the stage. And right about then is when Crack came and told you. You were standing with me when he shut everything down and told us.\u201d \u201cNone of you noticed her leaving the club area again?\u201d \u201cWe were all having fun, just crazy fun,\u201d Becca said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even notice the time with Angie. God, I took off my dress! Then the music stopped, and I saw Crack and Angie holding on to Shauna.\u201d \u201cWas the rest of your group in the club area?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Becca looked over at Angie. \u201cI think so.\u201d \u201cSome of the rest of you must\u2019ve used the restroom at some point.\u201d \u201cOh, sure.\u201d Becca nodded at Peabody. \u201cBut, like Angie said, we had the buddy system rule. Nobody goes alone, two or more at once. We weren\u2019t the only ones in the club, and, well, it\u2019s the Down and Dirty, so buddy system.\u201d \u201cWhy did she go without me?\u201d More tears spilled as Shauna gripped Becca\u2019s hand. \u201cWhy did she go back there by herself?\u201d Angie sighed. \u201cWhen I trailed her back to the ladies\u2019, she reminded me she used to be a kind of regular here.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019d booked a privacy room.\u201d \u201cWhat? But why?\u201d Shauna stared at Eve. \u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d \u201cMs. Hunnicut, did Erin have a black overnight case?\u201d Eve opened her hands to estimate size. \u201cWith a top handle?\u201d \u201cYeah, she did. Why?\u201d \u201cPink shoes? Heels, glittery, with butterflies on the straps?\u201d That question brought on a flood of tears. \u201cIt\u2019s how we met, how we met.\u201d When she broke down, Angie hugged her in, and Becca took over. \u201cShauna manages Fancy Feet, a shoe boutique. Erin saw the shoes in the window. She had her first real art show coming up that weekend and went in to try them on.\u201d \u201cWe connected.\u201d Shauna sobbed it. \u201cWe just connected. She said I should come to the show, and I did. She wore the shoes. We went out for a drink after, and just connected. I\u2019d only been with men before, I\u2019d never felt attracted to women. But we fell in love.\u201d \u201cYou love who you love.\u201d Peabody spoke softly. \u201cYou love the person. The shoes were the start of it, for both of you. So they\u2019re important.\u201d \u201cBut how did you know about the shoes?\u201d \u201cShe had the case in the privacy room, and the shoes in it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cShe also had a kind of costume, short grass skirt, leis, a card for you.\u201d \u201cI want the card. I need the card.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll get it to you. She scanned two tickets to Hawaii. Maui.\u201d \u201cBut\u2014no.\u201d With the back of her hand, she swiped at tears. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right. That was just a silly wish of mine, and we talked about going someday. We\u2019d save up for it. We wanted to get married now, so we\u2019d save up for a honeymoon in Maui because we didn\u2019t want to wait to get married.\u201d \u201cI checked. She bought the tickets, booked a hotel, three weeks ago. Do you know where she might have gotten the money?\u201d \u201cI\u2026\u201d Struggling, Shauna rubbed her hands over her face, but tears rolled through them. \u201cHer parents, maybe. They\u2019re great, but I don\u2019t see how they could afford all that.\u201d \u201cShe sold a painting? I bet she did,\u201d Becca put in. \u201cYou said she was spending a lot of time in the studio. She does mostly street art,\u201d Becca added. \u201cBut she shares a small studio with three other artists, and works through the\u2014 God, I can\u2019t think!\u201d \u201cSoHo Arts.\u201d Shauna closed her eyes. \u201cThey held her first real show. Glenda, Glenda Frost runs it. She couldn\u2019t come tonight because she\u2019s in Italy.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll check on that.\u201d \u201cShe was going to surprise me with something I wanted. Now she\u2019s dead.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t bring the case with her tonight?\u201d \u201cNo, no, we came together. She didn\u2019t have it. Maybe she came by earlier and left it with Crack.\u201d \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t. Who would she have trusted with it? Who would she have trusted with the case, with the surprise?\u201d \u201cAny of us,\u201d Angie said. \u201cWell, maybe not all of us, as some of us can\u2019t keep it zipped. She\u2019d have trusted me, or Becca. I don\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t. She never said a thing to me.\u201d \u201cOr to me. You think\u2026\u201d Becca pressed her lips together. \u201cYou think whoever she did tell killed her. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d \u201cNo one who knew her would do this. No one,\u201d Shauna insisted. \u201cEveryone was happy for us. My parents were surprised, but once they met her, they loved her, too. Our families, our friends, they were all happy for us.\u201d She dissolved into tears again. \u201cI have to tell my family. I have to tell her family. I don\u2019t know how.\u201d Peabody reached out. \u201cWe\u2019ll do that, Shauna.\u201d \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be right. You didn\u2019t know her. I have to tell them. I need to do that for her. It\u2019s all I can do for her now.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go with you, both of us.\u201d Angie looked at Becca. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cMs. Hunnicut, you said you dated men prior to meeting Erin.\u201d \u201cSo?\u201d She shot a hot look at Eve out of drenched eyes. \u201cDid you have any bad breakups? Anyone you dated resent you stepping away? Or that you fell in love with a woman?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She leaned against Becca, closed her eyes again. \u201cThe last person I hung with before I met Erin, we weren\u2019t serious that way. It was just convenient sex and someone to hang out with\u2014go to dinner or the vids or whatever with.\u201d \u201cCould we have his name? It\u2019s routine,\u201d Eve stressed. \u201cOh God, he\u2019s just a nice man, good in bed, and we made each other laugh. We\u2019re friends, just with, you know, benefits. He\u2019s coming\u2014was coming\u2014to the wedding. Marcus Stillwater. He\u2019s a publicist for Fordam Publishing.\u201d \u201cWho broke up with whom?\u201d \u201cI guess I pulled the plug on the sex. Just a month or so after I met Erin, and realized I had feelings. I told him I met someone I thought I could get serious about. We didn\u2019t fight, he wasn\u2019t upset. We were friends before we started sleeping together. We were friends when we slept together. We\u2019re still friends.\u201d \u201cHe met Erin then?\u201d \u201cSure. They liked each other.\u201d \u201cWhat about before him?\u201d She heaved out a breath. \u201cLook, I wasn\u2019t promiscuous, but I dated a lot of men. I didn\u2019t have sex with all of them. But I\u2019m twenty-six, I was a single woman in New York.\u201d \u201cNo one\u2019s judging you. It\u2019s routine,\u201d Peabody told her. \u201cEvery detail can matter.\u201d \u201cAll right. Okay.\u201d Shauna shoved at her hair again. \u201cThe guy I dated before Marcus, we were together a couple months. But it just didn\u2019t really work for me. It didn\u2019t click, so I broke it off. He wasn\u2019t happy about it, but I didn\u2019t break his heart, either.\u201d \u201cName?\u201d \u201cJon Rierdon. He runs a home goods store on \u2026 I don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good enough.\u201d \u201cHell, how far back should I go? If I track back to high school, there\u2019s Greg.\u201d Becca let out a quick laugh, then immediately winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to laugh. Greg, Shauna, and I all went to high school together. They were an item. Actually, The Item. The homecoming queen and the quarterback. Greg and I have been cohabs for over two years.\u201d \u201cWe all scattered after college. Greg and I kept in touch off and on. Then Becca and I ran into each other on the street, just hey.\u201d \u201cIt turned out we lived in the same neighborhood\u2014Shauna had just moved to the city, and we ran into each other.\u201d \u201cThere were two guys in college on the serious side,\u201d Shauna continued, \u201cand a couple\u2014no, three\u2014between that and Jon. Nobody got their hearts broken.\u201d \u201cWhat about Erin? Exes.\u201d \u201cI know a couple, but we didn\u2019t go into all that much. We were together, and that\u2019s what mattered.\u201d \u201cWould you know?\u201d Eve asked Angie. \u201cYeah, probably. I could give you ones I do know, but another thing I know. Erin didn\u2019t love anyone she was with before. Liked, was attracted to, enjoyed. But she didn\u2019t love until Shauna.\u201d \u201cNames would help, just to eliminate. Then we\u2019ll let you go. If you think of anything else, or have any questions, you can contact me or Detective Peabody. It would also help if you give us access to where you lived with Erin.\u201d \u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want to go back there, not yet.\u201d Her lips trembled. \u201cMaybe not ever.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me. I\u2019ve got room.\u201d Angie took her hand again. \u201cAs long as you need.\u201d \n Chapter Three When Eve judged she\u2019d gotten all she\u2019d get from the three women, she let them go. \u201cGo home, hit the rack. We\u2019ll meet up at the vic\u2019s apartment at oh-eight hundred. See if Feeney can spare McNab to check out the e\u2019s.\u201d \u201cCan do.\u201d Peabody rubbed her tired eyes. \u201cAre you heading out, too?\u201d \u201cI want a word with the sweepers and Crack, then yeah.\u201d As they stepped back into the club area, Eve looked around. The women, ringed around Shauna like a security team, filed out. \u201cNothing more we can do here tonight.\u201d After consulting with the sweepers, she walked to the rear door, stepped out. She scanned the short alley, where two white-suited sweepers filtered through the contents of the recycling bin. So easy, Eve thought. Just somebody turning into the alley on a hot, damp summer night, carrying a black case. Had she already given them the swipe? Probably, she thought. Most likely, since she\u2019d had company on that bathroom trip roughly an hour and fifteen minutes before TOD. But why? If she\u2019d wanted someone to bring it in that way, why not just go to the back door at some point, take the case? Thanks, pal. Can\u2019t say, she concluded. But if that had been the plan, it hadn\u2019t worked. Either way, she\u2019d given that case and access to the privacy room to someone she knew. Trusted. Either way, her killer had been in the room. Maybe they\u2019d convinced her to let them go in with her. Or they\u2019d waited for her in the room. Eve stepped back in. \u201cWaiting inside. She couldn\u2019t say when, for sure, she\u2019d be able to slip away unnoticed\u2014as proven by Decker on the john trip. Can\u2019t ask somebody to wait in an alley indefinitely.\u201d She walked down to the privacy room. Dim lights, soundproofing. Inside within seconds. Still, risky. She headed back to the club area, where only Crack and Roarke remained. They sat at the bar, and from the looks of it, had switched to water. \u201cThe sweepers are nearly done,\u201d she told Crack. \u201cGo home. They\u2019ll secure the place, seal it.\u201d \u201cHow long you shutting me down? Not giving you shit about it,\u201d he added. \u201cJust need to know.\u201d \u201cKeep it closed tomorrow. Give me another day on just the privacy room. If I hit on something that says longer, I\u2019ll let you know. But I don\u2019t see it.\u201d \u201cYou gonna loop me in?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d When his eyes narrowed, she narrowed her own. \u201cCan\u2019t and won\u2019t. If we have questions you might be able to answer, we\u2019ll ask them. If we have information I think you can expand on, I\u2019ll ask. Otherwise, I can\u2019t and won\u2019t.\u201d He stared down at his water, then looked at Roarke. \u201cHard-ass skinny white girl you hooked with.\u201d \u201cShe is. And that\u2019s one of the reasons she\u2019ll find who killed your friend, and who used your place to do it.\u201d \u201cGuess I hear that.\u201d He rose. \u201cYou\u2019ll work that security bullshit up for me?\u201d \u201cI will, yes.\u201d \u201cWell, fuck it. I guess I\u2019m going home.\u201d After watching him walk out, she turned to Roarke. \u201cWell, fuck it. I guess we\u2019re going home, too.\u201d He rose, took her hand. \u201cYou can tell me what you think on the way.\u201d \u201cSome I think, some I know,\u201d she said as they went out where the shallow puddles had dried. And the air felt as if it had absorbed every drop of wet. \u201cI know the killer was in the room. I think already in it when she went in. I know the killer brought in the case. I think she found a way to slip them the swipe so they could. Since she picked it up about noon, that leaves plenty of time for the handoff. That says she knew her killer, and trusted them enough with her big secret surprise. Had to, as the case didn\u2019t have a lock.\u201d She got in the car, stretched out her legs. \u201cI know the killer came prepared to kill, and I think they did it quickly from behind. Plus they weren\u2019t smart enough to take the case out with them and secure the door. Why leave the case, when that gives us something to work with? Why not secure the door so it takes longer to locate the body?\u201d \u201cPanic?\u201d Roarke suggested. \u201cThat\u2019s my initial thinking, and if so, it\u2019s most likely a first kill. As far as we know\u2014so that\u2019s not in the I Know column\u2014none of her group arrived at the D&D with the case. But without cams, no way to be sure. Plus, she could\u2019ve given the swipe to one of them earlier.\u201d \u201cThey come in the back, put the case in the room, then join the party.\u201d \u201cPossible. But then why didn\u2019t Albright get the swipe back? Can\u2019t ask her, so possible. Maybe one of them had something going with the vic at some point. Now she\u2019s marrying someone else, taking them to Maui. That bitch! Or one of them wants to have a thing with Hunnicut, so wants Albright out of the way so they can move in and comfort the grieving bride.\u201d \u201cExtreme, but not unprecedented.\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d She rolled her shoulders in an attempt to ease the stiffness. Had little success. \u201cI worked this case once\u2014back with Feeney. A woman meets this guy at a party. They have some party talk. The guy intros her to his wife, and they all have some party talk. The woman decides the guy\u2019s her soul mate. Consults a psychic who, for fifty bucks, confirms same. Tells her the wife will leave suddenly and clear the field. Wanting to speed things along, she throws a party, invites them and about three dozen of her friends and acquaintances. She slips into the john behind the wife, where she bashes her over the head with\u2014I\u2019m not making this up\u2014a frozen round of marble rye, then drowns her in a tub filled with scented water and floating candles.\u201d \u201cInventive.\u201d \u201cWould\u2019ve been more so if she hadn\u2019t stuck the bread back in the freezer. Parties are murder. Anyway, we got her.\u201d Eve circled her head to release tension in her neck, with a little more success. \u201cWe\u2019ll get this one, too. Should\u2019ve taken the case, ditched it and the contents somewhere.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s one of the partygoers, it\u2019s possible she didn\u2019t want to be absent that long.\u201d \u201cAlso possible. It would take a cold-ass mother to do the kill, then walk right back in and dance.\u201d She closed her eyes a minute, rolled her shoulders again. \u201cBut the world\u2019s got plenty of cold-ass mothers to go around.\u201d When he drove through the gates, she let out one long, relieved breath. \u201cHunnicut gave us access to their place. I sent Reo a warrant request just to back it up, but we\u2019ll hit that first thing. Hunnicut said nobody had keys except her and the vic.\u201d \u201cThe killer could\u2019ve made a copy along the way.\u201d \u201cYeah, but why not just take hers once she\u2019s dead? They took her \u2019link, and that tells me they\u2019ve had some communication on it that brings the killer into the light. Take her apartment key, or if they\u2019d copied it, they don\u2019t wait for after the kill to get in, remove any communication. McNab will know if they did.\u201d She got out of the car. \u201cPeabody was basically asleep on her feet when I sent her home. Hell, I was getting there myself. Morning\u2019s soon enough.\u201d As they went inside, she glanced at her wrist unit. \u201cI can get a solid three hours down. That\u2019ll work. You\u2019ll get less.\u201d He slipped an arm around her when they started up the stairs. \u201cI rescheduled my five A.M. I\u2019ll take the solid three with you.\u201d She tipped her head toward his shoulder. \u201cSlacker.\u201d \u201cThe privilege of being the boss.\u201d \u201cOf everything. \u2019Cept me.\u201d In the bedroom, she stripped off her jacket, her weapon harness, and, yawning, sat to pull off her boots. \u201cI need to talk to the victim\u2019s parents. Maybe she told them about the big surprise. Shauna indicated they couldn\u2019t afford it, but maybe they helped. Then there\u2019s the artists she shared studio space with. Unless they were all at the party. Need to check that.\u201d \u201cYou need to sleep first.\u201d And as she stripped down, he pulled a sleep shirt over her head. \u201cI do. I really do. Move over, tubby.\u201d She nudged the sprawled cat over, then sprawled herself. Facedown. Roarke slid in beside her, stroked a hand down her back. Since she went under before the second stroke, he set his internal alarm, and joined her. She woke to the glorious scent of coffee. Opening one eye, she saw Roarke sitting on the side of the bed with a mug in his hand. \u201cNeed that.\u201d \u201cI assumed you would.\u201d She sat up, took the mug, gulped some down. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty good deal.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m an excellent deal.\u201d Since she couldn\u2019t argue with that, she drank some more and studied him. Already dressed in one of his boss-of-the-universe suits\u2014this one a medium gray, probably linen\u2014with a deeper gray shirt and a perfectly knotted tie that blended the grays with a kind of\u2014she guessed\u2014maroon. He looked as fresh as a man who\u2019d just come off a relaxing weekend at some fancy spa. Plus, he smelled really good. It could irritate, but she had coffee. \u201cHow did you manage three hours down and get showered and dressed?\u201d \u201cEfficiency. I was tempted to shower with my wife, but that would\u2019ve led to other temptations. Neither of us have time for those temptations this morning.\u201d \u201cReally don\u2019t. So I\u2019m taking this coffee while I go be efficient.\u201d She drank more coffee as she went in to shower. Between that and the beat of hot water pumping from multiple jets, her brain unclouded enough to let her go over her morning agenda. Though she wished for time to set up her board and book in her home office, that had to wait. Apartment first, some conversations with neighbors. Have Peabody cross-check the partygoers with the other artists\u2014and that might add in some visits and conversations. The morgue. See what Morris could tell her. Track down where Erin had gotten the costume, and see if that led anywhere. Talk to the parents and the traveling gallery owner. But first, out of the shower, into the drying tube. Then more coffee. She tossed on a robe the color of the sea surrounding Roarke\u2019s private island. When she stepped out, he sat, the stock junk on-screen and muted. Two domed plates sat on the table of the sitting area while the cat, on the opposite side of the room, gulped down his own breakfast. Roarke set his tablet aside. \u201cWork continues apace at the Great House Project.\u201d \u201cJust what does that mean? There\u2019s slow pace,\u201d she said as she crossed over and filled her mug with coffee from the pot on the table. \u201cThere\u2019s jogging pace, a run-like-hell pace. So what pace is apace when it\u2019s one weird word? Like afoot. Whose foot is it, and why?\u201d She started to lift the dome to see what he\u2019d decided she\u2019d have for breakfast and saw him smiling at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cStarting the day with you is never boring.\u201d He lifted the domes himself to reveal golden omelets, crisp bacon, summer berries, and flaky croissants. Yeah, an excellent deal, even if he\u2019d snuck spinach into the omelet. \u201cSo does \u2018apace\u2019 mean ahead of schedule?\u201d \u201cIt does. Still a bit of time before everything\u2019s complete, but they can continue to move things into finished areas or where they\u2019re storing others in the garage. I thought we\u2019d have the garden sculpture you wanted for Mavis and the lamp you wanted for Peabody delivered next week. That way, Peabody can find the place she wants for the lamp, and we can set up the sculpture where Mavis wants it.\u201d \u201cFine, but that takes care of the whole \u2018we have to give you something for getting a house\u2019 thing, right?\u201d \u201cIt does. Though a bottle of wine when they have their housewarming, which they will, wouldn\u2019t be amiss.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s another.\u201d She pointed at him. \u201cApace, afoot, amiss. Why the extra letter? But anyway. Gifts? Check.\u201d She made a check mark in the air, then attacked the omelet. Spinach, no surprise, but plenty of cheese to smooth that out. \u201cAnd yeah, they\u2019re going to want to have a party. Nobody ever learns.\u201d \u201cSomeone could get bashed with a frozen round of marble rye.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s happened before,\u201d she said darkly. \u201cIt could happen again.\u201d He leaned over, kissed her. \u201cNever boring.\u201d She switched to bacon. \u201cThen Mavis is going to pop out Number Two. Except it\u2019s not popping. It\u2019s this whole weird, ungodly process.\u201d \u201cWhich you shouldn\u2019t bring up over breakfast. Please God,\u201d he added fervently. \u201cAnd she\u2019s already said we have to be there again.\u201d \u201cNot over breakfast. In fact, never speak of it.\u201d \u201cWait. Does that mean we have to have one of the girl parties, another shower thing?\u201d He took another bite of omelet. \u201cAnticipating that question, I asked Peabody. She said no, as they have all the baby gear already.\u201d \u201cThank Christ.\u201d \u201cBut there should be a gift once Number Two arrives.\u201d \u201cAnother gift.\u201d It never, ever ended! \u201cFor Mavis, for the kid?\u201d Roarke shot a warning stare at the cat, who\u2019d finished his breakfast and tried a casual saunter toward theirs. \u201cMy information is a gift for Mavis would be thoughtful, one for the baby is required.\u201d \u201cWell, shit.\u201d \u201cThe nursery is nearly done. Mavis and Leonardo decided on a magic theme.\u201d \u201cWhat, like rabbits coming out of hats?\u201d \u201cNot stage magic, darling. A magical forest theme with elves and winged faeries, friendly dragons, that sort.\u201d \u201cOh. Yeah, that sounds like them. But like what happens to get the kid out, I\u2019m not thinking about it yet.\u201d \u201cWell now, I had a thought\u2014on the gift, and it would cover all of it. Though Bella\u2019s getting a bed, and the crib and such will move to the nursery, the chair, the rainbow chair, isn\u2019t moving. It\u2019s Bella\u2019s, after all, and suits her new room. A magic forest chair would suit the nursery.\u201d \u201cHuh.\u201d \u201cThe same sort of chair, but with the nursery theme.\u201d \u201cThat really would cover it all. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d \u201cMavis already has Leonardo working on the fabric design, as it\u2019s something she wants. And he\u2019s agreed to distract her there, run it by us, then tell her there\u2019s a bit of a backlog, but it\u2019ll be done by the time they bring the baby home.\u201d \u201cSo another big secret surprise? Where did one of those just lead last night?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll keep privacy rooms and sex clubs off-limits.\u201d \u201cFine.\u201d Then she shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea.\u201d \u201cPeabody also mentioned a big-sister gift for Bella.\u201d Eve\u2019s jaw literally dropped. \u201cOh man, come on!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m merely the messenger.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll give Peabody a damn message.\u201d She pushed up and walked into her closet. \u201cDo we have to do this every time Mavis decides to get knocked up? Because I\u2019m telling you, she\u2019s not done!\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not think about that, either.\u201d As the cat rolled closer\u2014a new tactic\u2014Roarke pointed at him. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you think about a second breakfast, mate.\u201d In the closet, Eve thought about clothes. She hated thinking about clothes, but not as much as buying gifts. She decided, instead of thinking, to follow Roarke\u2019s lead. Gray trousers, a gray linen jacket. It had navy buttons, and she supposed that was supposed to mean navy pants. But screw that. She took care of the navy with a sleeveless tee, the belt, and the boots. Little thought required, so a win. When she stepped out, carrying the jacket, she frowned at the table. \u201cWhere\u2019d you put the stuff?\u201d \u201cInside the AutoChef panel.\u201d Nodding, Eve strapped on her weapon. She glanced at the cat, the panel. \u201cIt might take him awhile, but he\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d \u201cNot if I put a bloody lock on it.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be too sure.\u201d She tossed on the jacket, grabbed her badge and the rest. \u201cGotta go.\u201d \u201cAs do I. I\u2019ll walk out with you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you have a meeting?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve a car and driver waiting. I\u2019ll take the first meeting in the car, then the rest in my office.\u201d \u201cA mobile meeting. Shows you\u2019re a very busy man.\u201d \u201cAnd that I am.\u201d \u201cNo briefcase?\u201d \u201cAlready in the car. Summerset dealt with it.\u201d At the mention of his majordomo, Eve gave a suspicious scan of the foyer. But he didn\u2019t lurk there. \u201cWell, good luck with your half a million meetings.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve only scheduled a quarter million today.\u201d They stepped outside together. He took her face in his hands, kissed. \u201cTake care of my cop.\u201d \u201cCan do. No privacy rooms or rounds of marble ryes for me all day.\u201d Smiling, he skimmed a finger down the shallow dent in her chin. \u201cAnd good luck with the rest of it.\u201d She got in her car, and he in the back of the shiny black limo. It felt a little strange to drive out this way together, to find herself glancing back and imagining him running some important business meeting from the back of the shiny car. They\u2019d both left early enough to beat the hawking ad blimps. But not, she noted, the street traffic, the airtrams, or the bustle of working stiffs toward subway stations. The limo peeled off toward his Midtown offices, and she continued downtown. Plenty of people, she noted, crowding the corner carts for hot coffee, iced coffee, egg pockets, breakfast burritos. Pre-Roarke, she\u2019d have been one of them. So yeah, an excellent deal. A few blocks from her destination, the warrant came through. \u201cAnd that makes it nice and neat,\u201d she muttered. Maybe more likely, she thought, if Albright had anything concerning the Maui trip tucked away, she\u2019d have tucked it in the artist space. But they had to check. More, she wanted to see where and how the couple had lived. Private spaces told you things people often didn\u2019t. She hunted for parking, lucked into a street spot under a block away. Then spotted Peabody and McNab hoofing their way toward her as she got out of the car. Peabody\u2019s pink cowboy boots clomped; McNab\u2019s airboots with multicolored swirls pranced. His shirt somehow matched the boots, and his baggies shined neon blue. At least Peabody wore sensible khakis and a blue\u2014not neon\u2014top under a tan blazer. They held hands, but wisely uncoupled before they reached her. \u201cWarrant came through.\u201d She pointed down the block, then continued to walk. \u201cMcNab, I spotted door cams, so start with the security feed. Look for the black case. I don\u2019t expect to get that lucky, but let\u2019s cross it off. Also anyone entering from TOD to an hour after we released the party group. Then we\u2019ll want a search through any house e\u2019s for any reference to this surprise trip.\u201d \u201cAll over it and back again.\u201d \u201cAnything hinky with the e\u2019s, we take them in. We\u2019re authorized.\u201d She paused in front of the building for a longer look. An old, faded brick, pre-Urbans, that had held its own during that violent era. No graffiti, sensible riot bars on the first-floor windows. Reasonable security. A four-decker, no retail space. Probably a walk-up, she thought, grandfathered in before mandatory elevators. \u201cThey could both probably walk to work from here,\u201d Peabody commented. \u201cI checked, and Albright usually set up about six blocks from here, and her studio space is just under four. Fancy Feet is one crosstown block and one short block north. Rent takes a bite, but with two incomes, manageable. Just.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019d save on transpo.\u201d \u201cYeah, they moved in here together just about ten months ago. Both had studio apartments previously. Combining those rents, this place isn\u2019t much more. It\u2019s billed as a two-bedroom, but the second\u2019s smaller than your closet. I checked.\u201d \u201cTop floor, southwest corner. I checked,\u201d Eve said. \u201cLet\u2019s go have a look.\u201d She walked up, mastered in. The entrance area was smaller than her pre-Roarke closet, and barely fit the three of them. Not altogether a walk-up, she realized, as it had one elevator. One dubious elevator. She wouldn\u2019t have used it in any case. Stairs, barely wide enough for two across, had a sturdy rail that looked fairly new. No soundproofing, as she could hear voices\u2014on-screens, in actuality, and the requisite crying baby\u2014from behind doors painted what she thought of as apartment green. It looked and smelled reasonably clean. No trash on the cheap laminate floors, no graffiti on the builder\u2019s-beige walls. \u201cFind the security hub or building super, McNab.\u201d \u201cBoth basement level.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI checked.\u201d \u201cGood to start off the day efficient. Let\u2019s move.\u201d \n Chapter Four As they started up the steps, Eve heard Peabody whisper, \u201cLoose pants, loose pants.\u201d At Eve\u2019s cool stare, Peabody shrugged. \u201cIt helps.\u201d More noise on the second floor. Instead of a crying baby, a toddler wailed, \u201cNo! No! No!\u201d Eve knew it was a toddler, as it continued to wail as his mother carted him out of an apartment door. She knew it was the mother, as the woman with a messy tail of brown hair, an enormous bag on one shoulder, and a wailing kid on her opposite hip sent her an exhausted look. \u201cMy mother told me being a mom\u2019s the best job ever,\u201d the woman said. \u201cEvery day\u2019s an adventure, she told me. She must just laugh and laugh.\u201d She shifted the kid. \u201cHe knows,\u201d she said darkly now. \u201cWe didn\u2019t tell him, we didn\u2019t speak of it, but he knows we\u2019re going to the d-o-c for his c-h-e-c-k-u-p and his s-h-o-t.\u201d \u201cAw.\u201d With a sympathetic smile, Peabody reached in her jacket pocket and pulled out some sort of cracker she palmed to show the mom. \u201cCan he?\u201d \u201cAh\u2026\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re cops.\u201d Peabody showed her badge with her other hand. \u201cPeanut butter cracker. Still wrapped.\u201d \u201cOh. Okay.\u201d Peabody unwrapped the cracker, offered it. The kid stopped wailing, squealed \u201cCookie,\u201d and grabbed it. Mouth full, he grinned. \u201cBless you. A thousand blessings on you.\u201d \u201cNo problem.\u201d Continuing up, Eve shook her head. \u201cYou carry crackers in your pocket, Detective Loose Pants?\u201d \u201cPeanut butter\u2014for a boost when we miss lunch. Which we do. A lot.\u201d \u201cNow that you\u2019ve done your good deed for the day, record on.\u201d On the fourth floor, Eve turned to the apartment door. \u201cDallas, Lieutenant Eve, and Peabody, Detective Delia, entering residence of Shauna Hunnicut and Erin Albright, deceased.\u201d She mastered in, and when they stepped inside, took a long, slow scan of the living area. \u201cA shoe store manager and a street artist. They missed their calling. They should\u2019ve run a cleaning service.\u201d The small space shined like diamonds. Multicolored diamonds, Eve decided. The sofa wore a sapphire-blue cover and showed off half a dozen pillows of varying sizes, shapes, and patterns that\u2014somehow\u2014worked. Mismatched tables, all painted in happy colors, a pair of small chairs, both covered in hot candy pink, a chest painted bright white covered with pink-and-blue flowers. Art covered the walls. Cityscapes, still lifes, portraits. A small round table painted the blue of the sofa and flanked by two metal chairs painted the hot candy pink held a clear vase filled with white flowers. The two little front windows offered a view of the street below\u2014which the victim had captured in one of the many paintings. It struck Eve as not only amazingly clean, but girlie without the fuss and flounces. \u201cThey were really happy here,\u201d Peabody commented. \u201cYou can see it, and feel it. And you know, the victim\u2019s work is really good. At least for me, it pulls me right in.\u201d Because she agreed, Eve merely nodded as she looked over the tiny kitchen, separated from the rest by a short counter. They\u2019d removed a couple of cabinet doors so their dishes and glassware showed. \u201cGives it an illusion of space.\u201d Peabody wandered that way. \u201cYou have to be really organized and creative when you go with open cabinets. Looks like they were. A printout of their wedding e-vite on the fridge. I\u2019d say Albright designed it. There\u2019s a lot of her here. I can see why Hunnicut needs some time before coming back.\u201d \u201cAnd that gives us room to go through the place.\u201d Eve headed toward the hallway. They\u2019d set up the tiny bedroom Peabody spoke of as an office/art studio space. It held a desk painted a kind of coral color holding a mini D and C, a little vase of flowers, and a photo of the two women, heads together, beaming smiles. At the window\u2014about the same size and shape as Eve\u2019s skinny office window\u2014stood an easel on a square of paint-splattered white cloth. An unfinished painting stood on it\u2014a crowded subway scene. Beside it, a makeshift table held a palette, brushes. Peabody opened the closet. \u201cShoes! Glorious shoes! Hunnicut would get a discount. Man, they\u2019ve got some beauties. Two sizes\u2014six and a half, seven and a half. So they both stored shoes in here.\u201d \u201cFascinating.\u201d Eve opened a cabinet painted black, with a skyline of New York under a full white moon. \u201cPainting supplies. We\u2019ll leave the e\u2019s for McNab, for now. Let\u2019s see the main bedroom.\u201d The more generous space held a bed with a white duvet, deep blue shams, a bunch of fancy pillows. The wall behind the bed had a rainbow arching in a dreamy blue sky. The theme continued with a long dresser painted a pale, quiet green, the frame of the long oval mirror showing a blue a couple of notes up from the wall color. Rather than curtains, the trim around the privacy-screened window had vining flowers trailing along the white. \u201cThey wanted peaceful in here.\u201d Peabody sighed a little. \u201cThe whole place \u2026 they put a lot of time and thought and work into the whole place. It\u2019s really, really pretty.\u201d Just two people, Eve thought, making their nest, living their life, looking toward a future that would never happen. \u201cTake the nightstands. I\u2019ve got the closet.\u201d Inside she found clothes organized in two sections\u2014hers and hers. Below, a handmade pair of side-by-side drawers. Painted, of course, the frame the pale green, the drawers the dreamy blue. They held carefully folded sweaters, sweatshirts, rolled belts, winter-weight socks and tights. Hers and hers again, she thought as she searched through. On the side walls, handbags hung. She went through each. No hidden cash, no secret messages. Eve turned, faced the clothes. On each side, under clear protective wrap, hung their wedding dresses. No way to mistake that, she thought. One, strapless, had a short skirt, the kind that would flare out when you twirled. Albright\u2019s. The other had thin straps with a hint of sparkle, a longer, fuller skirt that fell from a nipped-in waist. They\u2019d both chosen white. \u201cTheir wedding dresses,\u201d Peabody said from behind her. \u201cThat\u2019s so sad. Some sex toys in the nightstands, and each had a tablet. I tried the wedding date as passcode, and bang on both. And they both have folders on there for wedding plans, starting like three months ago. They were having it at Hunnicut\u2019s parents\u2019 place in Brooklyn\u2014they have a yard. I\u2019ve got the guest list\u2014about seventy people. The caterer, photographer, the band, the florist, all of it. Each bride\u2019s parents were paying a third, and the brides a third. I\u2019d say that shows family support.\u201d \u201cMoney talks\u2014but you can\u2019t always be sure it\u2019s telling you the truth. I\u2019ve got the dresser. Take the bathroom. \u201cThat\u2019ll be McNab,\u201d Eve said when she heard the knock. \u201cHave him come back, give me a rundown, then he can take the e\u2019s.\u201d She walked to the dresser with its perfume bottles, two little catchall bowls, currently catching hairpins in one, a broken earring in the other. Another framed picture of both of them, ass to ass this time, in party dresses she\u2019d seen in the closet. She opened the first drawer as McNab bounced in. \u201cNo case on the twenty-four hours of feed, LT. I\u2019ve got the vic and her partner leaving together\u2014wearing what they wore at the club\u2014at about twenty-one-fifteen. The victim arrived home, alone, around two and a half hours before that. Hunnicut nearly an hour before that, also alone.\u201d He looked around the room as he spoke. \u201cThis is nice. Anyway, one couple came in the building after TOD. The super ID\u2019d them as tenants, a couple on the second floor. I stopped by on my way up here. Dinner, a show, then drinks with another couple. They\u2019ve got the receipts.\u201d \u201cOkay. You can start on the e\u2019s in the second bedroom.\u201d \u201cOn it. This is a really nice place,\u201d he said again as he went out. The first drawer, a jewelry drawer with a sectioned insert. From the looks of it, they hadn\u2019t separated their own, but mixed them together in sections for bracelets, earrings, rings, necklaces. But even she recognized two distinct styles. The bolder and the more conservative. She took out two jeweler\u2019s boxes, opened the first. A white-gold band with beaded edges. The ring in the second box matched. Yeah, Eve thought as she replaced them. It was fucking sad. She replaced them, went drawer by drawer. No secrets spilled out. And clearly each had her own side\u2014two distinct styles again, which had her confirming her thought that the bold equaled the victim, the more conservative the fianc\u00e9e. She found a red, hinged-lid box on what she believed was Hunnicut\u2019s side, bottom drawer. A few more pieces of jewelry. As she finished up, Peabody came back in. \u201cNothing but what you\u2019d expect in a bathroom shared by two women. Some OTC meds, no illegals, makeup, hair and skin care, and so on.\u201d \u201cNothing here, either. They didn\u2019t hide things from each other, not that I can see. Maybe that\u2019s why when she hid the trip from Hunnicut, she went over the top on it. \u201cLiving room, kitchen.\u201d She stopped at the second bedroom. \u201cNot finding anything that pops, Dallas,\u201d McNab told her. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a joint account and split expenses down the middle. It looks like the victim did some moonlighting. I\u2019ve got payments listed\u2014fairly small ones\u2014from Your Event Caterers, Lonestar Grill, Quick and Clean Maid Service. All cash deposits.\u201d \u201cPaid her under the table.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d say affirmative. Also cash deposits from her sales\u2014street sales. She kept good records. Some payments from sales through the gallery she worked with. Hunnicut\u2019s straight from the Fancy Feet place.\u201d \u201cNo record of Albright buying those tickets, deposit for the room in Maui?\u201d McNab held up a finger. \u201cI\u2019ve got it, but she separated it from their joint. Sort of buried it. She got a solid payment from the gallery in SoHo. Almost twenty large\u2014and a few days later, another for three, and she dumped them both in a different account, where she\u2019s also been slipping in some of the moonlighting cash\u2014probably tips\u2014for a couple months, along with what looks like some street sales. She had just over thirty-five in it\u2014subheaded the file Shauna\u2019s Big Dream.\u201d \u201cYeah, that fits.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got her notes, her math here where she buried the transactions. She bought the tickets, booked the room, and earmarked some for food, drink, fun.\u201d He glanced up. \u201cShe added some heart, smiley face, palm tree, and popping champagne emojis. Much love and happy all around.\u201d \u201cOkay. Take it in, dig some more on communications. Maybe Albright got some blowback, some threats, some something and deleted. Maybe she has emails with whoever brought in the case, and deleted. Have a look at the tablets for now, and we\u2019ll finish up.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long to finish, not with a place so clean, neat, and relatively spare. She ordered transpo for McNab to take the e\u2019s into Central, generated a receipt for them for Hunnicut. When she reached the car with Peabody, Eve considered the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty of room. We\u2019ll swing by the art studio, see if any artists are in residence. All of them live close, one in the same building, so we\u2019ll take them all if we can.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to build a toy chest.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cBella already has one. I\u2019ll build one for Number Two, paint it. I\u2019m no artist, but I can handle magic trees and some birds, I think I could handle a dragon. Maybe. That\u2019s the nursery theme.\u201d \u201cI know the nursery theme.\u201d Eve swung into traffic. \u201cRight. The chair. Leonardo\u2019s designing the fabric. Big secret, I\u2019m zipped on it. Hey, I can try to do something that works with the chair. They seriously love the one you gave her for Bella\u2014the chair.\u201d \u201cI know about the damn chair, Peabody. We\u2019re on a murder case.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re driving. Maybe a chest with doors on the front that open out. Or \u2026 make it like a treasure chest, and do a lift-out shelf. Or\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll stuff your dead, mangled body in the chest and drop it in the Hudson.\u201d She pulled into a loading zone at the building, an old converted warehouse. After flipping on her On Duty light, she stepped out. The street level held commercial spaces, including an art supply store, a tattoo parlor, and a vegan caf\u00e9. Above, two levels of apartments. The studio space took half the fourth floor and an alternative health clinic the other half. \u201cTrina gets acupuncture in the Natural Health Clinic up there.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWell, she\u2019s on her feet all day in the salon, or at Seventy-Five. She says it keeps her balanced.\u201d \u201cHow does having somebody stick needles in you keep you balanced?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d \u201cThat was a question not looking for an answer.\u201d Eve walked to the residential door, buzzed the studio. She gave it thirty seconds, was about to buzz Anton Carver\u2014one of the artists\u2014when the staticky voice answered. \u201cJen?\u201d \u201cDallas,\u201d Eve answered. \u201cLieutenant Dallas and Detective Peabody, NYPSD.\u201d \u201cHa ha.\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d No scanner, Eve noted, no door cam. \u201cWe need to speak with Donna Fleschner, Anton\u2014\u201d \u201cYou for Donna? Dallas and Peabody for me?\u201d A snorting laugh came through the static. \u201cYeah, right. I\u2019m usually up for pranks, but I\u2019m working, so\u2014\u201d \u201cBuzz us in, Ms. Fleschner, or I\u2019ll master in.\u201d \u201cShit, like I\u2019ve got time for this!\u201d But the buzzer sounded, the locks clicked open. Inside, the entrance proved narrow due to the big-ass cargo elevator. Without a thought, Eve took the clanging metal stairs. \u201cLoose pants. Even looser pants.\u201d The owner had soundproofed here, so the only noise came from boots on metal treads as they walked to the fourth floor. Eve buzzed again at the wide double doors with a sign that read: STARVING ARTISTS AT WORK Half the door opened a crack, and a bright blue eye peered out. That eye popped wide as the woman behind the door said, \u201cHoly shit! Not a prank. Holy shit!\u201d The door shut, chains rattled, then the door swung wide. \u201cHoly shit! It\u2019s Dallas and Peabody. Did Jen get you to come? My birthday\u2019s not until next month.\u201d \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t. Can we come in?\u201d \u201cWell, hell yeah! I never thought I\u2019d actually meet Dallas and Peabody, in the flesh.\u201d Donna, currently goggling, had her multicolored streaky hair bundled back. She wore a white tank\u2014as generously streaked with paint\u2014and a pair of knee-length shorts on a lanky frame. \u201cAfter I saw the vid, I downloaded the first book\u2014already read the second\u2014can\u2019t wait for the vid. And I started following your cases. Wild stuff! Whoa, check it! You guys are mag cops. I mean so mag. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re standing here. Shit, we don\u2019t have any coffee. I had to get my kick start at the cart this morning. I can go get\u2026\u201d She finally ran down, then took a step back. \u201cYou\u2019re standing there,\u201d she said. \u201cOh God, oh Jesus, do I know somebody who\u2019s dead?\u201d \u201cI regret to inform you Erin Albright was killed early this morning.\u201d Now, her face sheet white, she took two stumbling steps back. \u201cNo, that\u2019s no way. She and Shauna \u2026 They partied last night with a bunch of friends at the Down and Dirty. I know Crack, okay? I know that dude. You know him. No way that happens in his place.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid it did.\u201d \u201cBut \u2026 no. She and Shauna, they\u2019re getting married in a few days. This can\u2019t be happening.\u201d She staggered back to the lump of couch in the center of the room. \u201cNot Erin. This can\u2019t be happening to Erin.\u201d \u201cWould you like me to get you some water, Ms. Fleschner?\u201d Donna lifted shocked and swimming eyes to Peabody. \u201cPlease. We got a cooler back there. Please.\u201d She covered her face with her hands, then dropped them. \u201cHow?\u201d she asked Eve. \u201cWhy? Oh fuck, just fuck. Where\u2019s Shauna? Oh Jesus, poor Shauna. They loved each other. You\u2019ve got to know they loved each other. Shauna would never, ever hurt Erin.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not a suspect. Why weren\u2019t you at the party last night?\u201d \u201cI was in Baltimore. My sister had a baby, so I took a shuttle down when she was in labor the day before, with my mom. Quentin James MacAbee took his time arriving, like twenty hours or something.\u201d Swiping at tears, she took the tube of water Peabody offered. She cracked it, drank, struggled to continue. \u201cOur mom\u2019s staying down there for like a week, but I was going to try and take the nine o\u2019clock shuttle back last night. I missed it, then there were all these damn storms up and down the East Coast, and I didn\u2019t land in New York until around midnight.\u201d She sniffled, drank some more. \u201cAfter all that, I just didn\u2019t have the juice to glamour up and hit the party. I just didn\u2019t have it in the tank. Maybe if I\u2019d been there\u2014\u201d \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered,\u201d Peabody said, and sat beside her. Strong, ropey muscled arms, Eve thought. Tall enough. With an alibi easy to check. \u201cCan you give us the hospital or birthing center, and do you have your shuttle ticket receipt?\u201d \u201cYes. Lady Madonna Birthing Center in Baltimore. My sister\u2019s Alyce\u2014with a y\u2014Fleschner. I\u2019ve got the receipts, going and coming, on my \u2019link.\u201d She pulled it out of her pocket, swiped up the receipts before offering the \u2019link to Eve. \u201cI know you have to ask. You\u2019re mag cops, and you have to ask. I swear I\u2019d cut off my fingers before I\u2019d hurt Erin. I transitioned five years ago, and she was with me all the way. It hurt my mother, and I love my mother. She thought I was gay, and she accepted that without hesitation. But facing the reality that the son, Don, she loved was a woman inside? That hurt her. Erin was there for me, and for my mom, too. She helped me in so many ways I\u2019ll never be able to pay back.\u201d Eve handed her the \u2019link. \u201cShe trusted you.\u201d \u201cYes, of course. We trusted each other.\u201d \u201cSo you knew about the trip?\u201d \u201cThe trip? What trip?\u201d \u201cTo Maui?\u201d \u201cMaui? Sure, down the road. They needed to save\u2026\u201d She trailed off. \u201cWait. The paintings. She sold those paintings. Man, she worked so hard on those paintings. I\u2019m telling her to take it easy, how she had a wedding coming, but she pushed on them. And damn, they were so good. She sold them, but she asked me to keep the sale on the down-low.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you why?\u201d Swimming blue eyes met Eve\u2019s. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have to tell me anything. She asked, that\u2019s all. Was she going to surprise Shauna with the big dream? At the party?\u201d \u201cIt appears so.\u201d Tears rolled. \u201cThat\u2019s so like her. Just so Erin. She must\u2019ve had something in her overnight. Leis or a pineapple or\u2026\u201d Donna covered her face again. \u201cGod. Erin.\u201d \u201cHow do you know about the overnight case?\u201d \u201cI was supposed to bring it. She brought it here a few days ago. When?\u201d Now she pressed her hand to the side of her head as if to shove the memory through. \u201cA week or two after the big sale. I don\u2019t know, last week? I think last week. She stowed it back in her supply area, and asked me to bring it in, to the party.\u201d \u201cBut you didn\u2019t know what was in it?\u201d \u201cI asked, like what\u2019s up, and she said she had a surprise for Shauna. A surprise for everybody, so not to look, just to bring it to the party. She had a privacy room booked, and she\u2019d give me the swipe when I got there so I could put it in the room.\u201d After an uneven breath, Donna drank more water. \u201cI tagged her from the shuttle station after I missed the nine o\u2019clock. No, I still thought I could make it. I tagged her like about ten, when they started announcing more delays.\u201d She swiped at her phone again to bring up the tags. \u201cMan, she looked so happy, and the place was already starting to rock. I told her I didn\u2019t know when the hell I\u2019d get out of Baltimore, and I guess I was a little weepy with it. I really wanted to be there, and I was stuck. Then I remembered the overnight, and got weepier.\u201d She wiped away more tears. \u201cAll about me, right? She said not to worry about the overnight, she had a backup handling it\u2014just in case\u2014since I had to go to Baltimore. To fly safe, how we\u2019d party twice as hard at the wedding if I stayed stuck. She said, \u2018Love you, babe.\u2019 That\u2019s the last thing she said to me. \u2018Love you, babe.\u2019\u201d \u201cWho would have been her backup?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Angie maybe, or Becca, or really most anybody at the party. I didn\u2019t ask. I was tired, feeling sorry for myself. Is it important? I can ask everybody.\u201d \u201cYes, it\u2019s important. We\u2019ve spoken with everyone who was there. Show us where she kept the case.\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d Rising, Donna gestured toward an easel with a painting of an old man sitting on a bench, a spotted dog at his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s my area. Anton is over there. He does mostly commercial art\u2014for hotels, office buildings. Roy\u2019s there. He\u2019s been doing a lot of mural work lately, but he still comes in a few times a week. And Erin\u2019s here.\u201d Like the other stations, it had a worktable, a stool, shelves holding jars and tubes of paint, supplies. She\u2019d stacked canvases, finished, half-finished, blank, against the wall. None sat on the easel. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t started anything since the sale. And she had plenty finished to sell from her street spot. Plus, she\u2019d do on-the-spot portraits\u2014pencil sketches, charcoals, pastels. Tourists go for those.\u201d As she spoke, Donna stroked a hand over the easel. \u201cShe put the case right there, bottom shelf.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t worry about your studio mates poking into it?\u201d Peabody asked. \u201cOh, no. Don\u2019t mess with anyone else\u2019s shit. Hard-and-fast rule. Plus, neither of them would\u2019ve noticed it.\u201d \u201cWould she have asked either of them to bring it in for her?\u201d Donna shook her head at Eve. \u201cI can\u2019t see that. We\u2019re friendly, and we\u2019re supportive of each other\u2019s work. But we\u2019re not real tight. And Roy, he works nights, waits tables at \u2026 ah, Cuchina\u2014that\u2019s it. He\u2019s talking about quitting now that his mural work\u2019s taking off. And Anton\u2014Anton\u2019s a talented artist, but just not the kind of guy you ask for a favor outside of the art. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why it matters.\u201d \u201cEvery detail matters.\u201d Eve\u2019s eye landed on a canvas, a painting of an Italian place, a pizzeria. Bright colors, people sitting at booths and tables, drinking wine, eating a slice, a waitress in motion with a loaded pie on a tray. The long counter at the front window where people could sit on stools and watch New York go by. A lone figure sat there, facing the window, a slice in one hand. As she had when she\u2019d first arrived in New York. \u201cI know that place,\u201d she murmured. \u201cOh yeah, Polumbi\u2019s, one of our favorites. Great pizza. She really captured the vibe.\u201d \u201cYeah, she did.\u201d Pulling herself out, Eve turned to Donna again. \u201cWho has access to the studio?\u201d \u201cThe four of us. Roy\u2019s got a serious girlfriend, so I guess she would. Shauna.\u201d Donna lifted her shoulders. \u201cI can\u2019t think why anyone else would.\u201d \u201cAll right. We appreciate your time and cooperation. If you think of anything else, contact me or Detective Peabody.\u201d Eve offered her a card. \u201cAgain, we\u2019re sorry for your loss.\u201d \u201cCan I\u2014could I talk to Shauna?\u201d \u201cI think talking to someone who was close to Erin would be good.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll find out, won\u2019t you? It\u2019s not just a vid, is it? You\u2019ll find the bastard who did this to Erin.\u201d Never make promises on an investigation, Eve reminded herself. But she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a vid.\u201d As they started out, Peabody stopped, turned back. \u201cI just wanted to say, I really like what you\u2019re working on. The man on the bench with the dog. It\u2019s restful. The man and the dog love each other. It just shows.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d Donna\u2019s eyes filled again. \u201cThanks for that.\u201d Eve started down the stairs. \u201cShe could\u2019ve had somebody take that trip to and from Baltimore. She didn\u2019t,\u201d Eve added as Peabody started to speak. \u201cBut check her alibi\u2014the birthing center, the shuttle station security feed. Let\u2019s cross her all the way off.\u201d \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. We need to check, but she didn\u2019t. She loved Albright. Like the man and the dog, it showed.\u201d \u201cAgreed. We\u2019ll do runs on the other two artists, confirm where they were from twenty-three hundred until midnight. But I think she knew Albright through and through. When she says Albright wouldn\u2019t have asked either of them, I lean that way.\u201d \u201cBut we cross them all the way off.\u201d \u201cWe do.\u201d On the street, she considered the distance to the Down and Dirty. \u201cTen-minute walk from here to Crack\u2019s place. Plenty of time from when Fleschner tagged Albright from Baltimore for Albright to tag her backup if she hadn\u2019t already. They get here, swipe in\u2014the swipes for this building and the studio were in Albright\u2019s purse, not the apartment. Killer goes to the club\u2014probably back door again. She gives him the swipes\u2014and thanks so much\u2014he walks here, gets the case, walks back.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t meet him at the back door the second time,\u201d Peabody began. \u201cDoesn\u2019t need to.\u201d Eve walked to the car. \u201cKiller slips in the back, goes straight to the privacy room\u2014she\u2019d already given him that pass. Set down the case, and wait. When it\u2019s done, put the swipes back in her purse. \u201cWhy leave the case? Leaving the case is stupid.\u201d Drumming her fingers on the wheel, she waited for a break in traffic. \u201cNot much time to plan a murder, though, or come up with the weapon.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to say they didn\u2019t need it. Maybe just waiting for an opening. Then a baby decides it\u2019s time to come out. Add storms along the East Coast, shuttle delays, and you\u2019ve got one.\u201d She swung into traffic. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t impulse. Maybe the time and place were. But somebody wanted Erin Albright dead.\u201d \n Chapter Five \u201cAlibi checks.\u201d As Eve drove, Peabody viewed the security feed sent by the Baltimore station. \u201cShe\u2019s half-asleep in a chair in the terminal at twenty-three hundred, and I\u2019ve got her boarding the shuttle a few minutes later. Considering the time she landed, and the distance from the station here to the studio, to her apartment, she couldn\u2019t have made it before midnight.\u201d \u201cThoroughly crossed off. Cross-check the moonlighting gigs with the partygoers.\u201d \u201cI remember one had a catering business. Let me check my notes.\u201d \u201cDo that, and see if you can find her connection to the other two venues. Shauna would know, but I don\u2019t want to follow up with her yet.\u201d \u201cWe should\u2019ve asked Fleschner.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t want to do that until the thoroughly crossed-off. You can start on that angle while we check in with Morris.\u201d \u201cHow many mornings do you figure we visit the morgue?\u201d \u201cToo many.\u201d After pushing through a tangled knot of traffic, Eve parked. And with Peabody, started down the long white tunnel of the city\u2019s dead. \u201cI\u2019ve got Tricia Pilly\u2014the caterer. Maura Lang, bartender, the grill. And a Chassie Gordon, daughter of Blondina Gordon\u2014owner of the maid service.\u201d \u201cGood. Find a seat, have conversations.\u201d Eve continued on, then pushed open the doors of Morris\u2019s work home. Music played, something soft and bluesy, as he stood beside the body, his hands in the chest cavity. Under his protective cape, he wore an oatmeal-colored suit with a pale blue shirt and a tie of a deeper shade of blue. He had his black hair in a long braid, starting high on his head and threaded with cord in the deep blue. He lifted his long, dark eyes to Eve, and sighed. \u201cAnd so she\u2019ll be the center of a memorial instead of a bride.\u201d \u201cShe trusted the wrong person. Don\u2019t know who yet, but it killed her. Piano wire?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d say yes. A pity something designed for beauty and enjoyment would be used to end a life.\u201d \u201cPeople are fucked up. They\u2019ll find a way to kill with pretty much anything.\u201d \u201cI once had a victim on my table killed with a binky.\u201d \u201cA what?\u201d \u201cA baby\u2019s pacifier.\u201d Even then, it took her a minute to identify what she thought of as a plug. \u201cOh, yeah, yeah, I remember that. It wasn\u2019t my case, but I remember hearing about it. Father went nuts, forced it down the mother\u2019s throat so she choked on it. Why do they call it a binky?\u201d \u201cI have no idea. Where\u2019s our Peabody?\u201d \u201cRunning down a few things. Never going to be able to trace piano wire.\u201d \u201cWire used with considerable force, and as your on-scene speculated, from behind, drawing upward, then crossed in the back.\u201d \u201cSome sort of handles or grips on the ends.\u201d \u201cFor this kind of force, yes. The skin under her nails is hers. The lab has the broken nails from the sweepers, but the trace under those will likely be hers. She dug at her own throat to try to drag the wire away. As deeply as it cut in, she wouldn\u2019t have fought for long.\u201d No, Eve thought, studying the body. Not for long. \u201cNo other defensive wounds?\u201d \u201cNone. The contusions here, here? From a blow to a solid surface\u2014the door, as you\u2019ve already concluded. And these? From the fall when she went down.\u201d \u201cHe took the murder weapon with him. Stick it in a bag along with her \u2019link, the jewelry he took off her, any cash she had, stuff it in your pocket, walk out. Easy to dispose of in a recycler as you go. Smarter to do that a bit at a time, using multiples. \u201cDid he keep a trophy?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d \u201cThere are no indications of sexual abuse ante- or postmortem.\u201d \u201cNo, the killer didn\u2019t care about that. This was personal, but not sexual. A straight kill, with a half-assed attempt to make it look like a robbery.\u201d \u201cHalf-assed indeed,\u201d Morris agreed. \u201cShe\u2019d consumed a considerable amount of alcohol\u2014it was a party, after all. Her reflexes would have been slowed. She\u2019d had some bar snacks. Pretzels, some nachos, and some pasta primavera earlier, about seven, given the TOD.\u201d He walked over to wash his sealed hands. \u201cOtherwise, I find no signs of alcohol abuse, illegals use. The tox screen will confirm that. A healthy young woman, no body or face work, good muscle tone, and a small heart tattoo on her left buttocks.\u201d He lifted his hands. \u201cShe can\u2019t tell me more.\u201d \u201cThen it\u2019ll have to be enough. Thanks. I\u2019ll tell Shauna and the victim\u2019s family to contact you about coming in.\u201d \u201cGood hunting,\u201d he called as she went out. Spotting her, Peabody rose, but continued to talk on her \u2019link. \u201cNo, I appreciate the time, and I\u2019d maybe contact Angie to see how Shauna\u2019s doing.\u201d As Peabody finished up, Eve pushed open the outside door. \u201cOkay,\u201d Peabody began. \u201cStatements are Albright was always open to off-the-books work if she didn\u2019t have something else going. So whenever one of the three venues we have needed more hands, they\u2019d tag her. Usually she said yes. Which she did to a cleaning job yesterday morning. She worked with an Andrew Minor, from eight to about eleven-thirty. That\u2019s confirmed.\u201d \u201cFinished there, went by the D&D to pick up the swipe,\u201d Eve concluded. \u201cYeah, she told Minor she had some errands. As it was rarely more than a hundred bucks, they paid her in cash. And she\u2019d make that or more in tips with the bar and the catering deal. I hear personable, friendly, efficient, good worker from all of them. Oh, and Chassie isn\u2019t employed by her mother\u2019s company. She works at the Met\u2014the museum\u2014but will occasionally pitch in.\u201d In the car, Peabody strapped in. \u201cShe and the victim went to high school together, and Albright worked part-time and a chunk of the summer with the cleaning service.\u201d \u201cOkay. We\u2019re going to head in. You can do the runs. Start with the other artists. Unlikely the killer would\u2019ve stayed\u2014had to get rid of the murder weapon, what he took off the body. But we\u2019ll run McNab\u2019s group, just to cover it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get it rolling. You know, both Albright and Hunnicut have what feels like a tight circle of friends, and in both cases some of that going back to high school.\u201d \u201cOkay, and?\u201d \u201cWell, a lot of people\u2014probably most\u2014scatter after high school. Different colleges, jobs, interests, locations. But these two found their tribe\u2014or a member of their tribe\u2014early and stuck. Stuck and expanded, then like blended tribes. \u201cIt\u2019s like you and Mavis.\u201d Though she saw where Peabody was going, Eve decided to make her work for it. \u201cMavis and I never planned to marry each other.\u201d \u201cNow that I think about it\u2026\u201d Peabody angled her head. \u201cYou\u2019d make a cute couple. But what it is? The two of you recognized each other, on some level. So even though you busted her for street grifting way back, the two of you stuck. I met Mavis through you, and we have that hook, but we also have our own level of friendship. Same with the rest of the tribe.\u201d Eve pulled into the garage at Central. \u201cNow we have a tribe?\u201d \u201cSure. You, Mavis, me, Nadine, Reo, Mira, Trina\u2014\u201d \u201cWait!\u201d After she got out of the car, Eve slammed the door. \u201cDon\u2019t I get a vote on tribe membership? I never voted for Trina.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a democracy, it\u2019s a tribe. Louise, Callendar, and Harvo are in there. We\u2019re connected, and we\u2019re connected inside the connection. We\u2019re all separate women with different backgrounds, personalities, and all that, but together? Tribe.\u201d They crossed the garage to the elevators. \u201cIt feels to me like Albright and Hunnicut worked the same way, so it\u2019s hard to see a member of their tribe having any part in the murder.\u201d \u201cSo, you\u2019ve never heard of intertribal warfare or treachery?\u201d Frowning, Peabody got on the elevator with Eve. \u201cOkay, point, but wouldn\u2019t it be hard to keep that hidden? Hidden so well, nobody else in the tribe got a hint?\u201d \u201cPeabody, if people weren\u2019t at least half-decent at wearing masks, we\u2019d never have to investigate a homicide. We\u2019d just scan the tribe, say, and point, \u2018You, you there with the murder face. You\u2019re under arrest.\u2019 Then the judge and/or jury would take one look when he went to trial and it\u2019s: \u2018Murder Face is guilty on all counts.\u2019\u201d \u201cMurder Face,\u201d Peabody speculated as the elevator bumped to a stop. When the doors opened, two uniforms and a guy with clown-orange hair, blue baggies with rainbow suspenders, and a shirt that read WHEE!! stepped on. \u201cWhat\u2019s a murder face look like? Bared teeth? Slitty eyes?\u201d Clown Hair turned around, blew a small blue bubble with his gum. Obviously one of Feeney\u2019s, Eve thought. \u201cIs it a crime of passion or planned?\u201d \u201cPlanned.\u201d \u201cDitch the teeth and slitty eyes. You\u2019d go for something like\u2026\u201d He had bright green eyes, animated eyes that suddenly went blank. Not flat like a cop\u2019s, Eve noted. But just dead. Like a shark\u2019s. And she had to admit he pulled it off. \u201cNah.\u201d One of the uniforms shook her head as the elevator stopped again and more cops filed on. \u201cMe? I\u2019d go for the friendly face.\u201d She burst out with a wide smile and eyes just over the edge of crazy. \u201cThen it\u2019s \u2018Hey, pal,\u2019 right before you shove the knife in their throat.\u201d The other uniform disagreed. \u201cNot me. I\u2019d go for the helpless, with mild distress. \u2018Oh, could you give me a hand? I can\u2019t quite\u2014\u2019 Then you bash them over the head.\u201d By the time the elevator stopped again, every cop in the car had an opinion on Murder Face. Eve squeezed out and headed for the glides. Peabody trotted after her. \u201cI never thought about how diverse and varied murder faces are.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry I brought it up.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s a good point. And it\u2019s not like I just look at the surface\u2014I know better. But the friendships in this tribe just strike me as the real deal.\u201d \u201cRemember poisoned champagne, the devoted wife, the loving husband? That bond came off real.\u201d \u201cWell, yeah, but she was a professional. Actress, I mean. She knew how to put on the show.\u201d \u201cAny killer worth his salt knows how to put on the show. And what the fucking fuck does that mean? The salt? Why did I say that? That\u2019s what happens,\u201d she said darkly, \u201cyou get sucked into spouting those sayings that make no sense. Sucked in.\u201d She jumped off the glide and arrowed toward Homicide. One foot in the door, and Jenkinson\u2019s tie assaulted her with its multicolored smiley-faced cartoon stars over a wild blue sky. \u201cDetective Sergeant.\u201d \u201cYo, Loo!\u201d \u201cStatus.\u201d \u201cRocking and a-rolling. Carmichael and Santiago caught one about an hour ago. Baxter and Trueheart\u201d\u2014he chin-pointed to where Baxter in his sharp suit worked his \u2019link, and the earnest-faced Trueheart his comp\u2014\u201cthey\u2019re following up some leads.\u201d In acknowledgment, Baxter tapped a finger to his temple in salute. \u201cMe and Reineke got a breather, so we dug out a cold one.\u201d \u201cNo case, however cold, can outwit the badge,\u201d Reineke said. \u201cLet me know if you thaw it out. Runs, Peabody, and get an update from McNab.\u201d She strode straight to her office, and straight to the AutoChef for coffee. Then with said coffee, took two quiet minutes at her skinny window with New York rocking and a-rolling below. Peabody wasn\u2019t wrong about how the friendships and bonds of the group connection to the victim and Hunnicut felt genuine. But feelings weren\u2019t facts. Resentments and worse could and did simmer well under the surface until something\u2014anything\u2014set them to boil. At this point, evidence indicated\u2014strongly\u2014the victim knew her killer. A member of the tribe, as Peabody termed it? Maybe, maybe not. But someone known, someone trusted enough to do a favor and keep a secret. And that, she thought, equaled: Advantage badge. She sat at her desk and opened the murder book. Another hit of coffee, and she began on her board. Plenty of names and faces, she thought, and the bulk of them already eliminated due to their whereabouts at TOD. But that didn\u2019t mean they had no connection to the murder. Advertent, or inadvertent. Friendships were often complicated, she thought as she worked. And man, could she attest there. Then those connections within the larger group brought in different levels, different dynamics. Friend A\u2019s great, Friend B says to Friend C. And Friend C agrees, but adds how it bugs the crap out of her when Friend A does X. And snickering in solidarity, Friend B agrees there. Right before she tags up Friend A and tells her how Friend C trashed her about X. She\u2019d heard that kind of bullshit plenty in school, in the Academy, and even on the job. She sat, put her feet up, studied the board. And in that big a group, wouldn\u2019t you have some overlap in relationships? Somebody slept with somebody else, who slept with another somebody. She got up to pace, to consider the next step. Peabody\u2019s pink boots clomped toward her office. \u201cThe two other artists\u2014both clear. Anton Carver was uptown at a swank dinner party. Lilibeth Warsaw, art patron, arranged it, and it checks out he was there until right about midnight. She had him taken home, her car, her driver. It all checks.\u201d \u201cAll right.\u201d \u201cRoy Lutz was at a bar, Lower East. Its friends and family sort of opening. He\u2019d painted the wall murals. About thirty people there, and I checked with several already, will swear he was there until nearly one this morning. And he had a date\u2014the serious girlfriend\u2014who swears they went to his place after. He was still sleeping when she left for work this morning about eight-thirty.\u201d Eve just nodded, then stopped to study the board from a new angle. \u201cMcNab\u2019s got nothing. Nothing deleted or hidden on any of the e\u2019s\u2014except what he already found re the vic ordering the tickets, booking the hotel in Maui.\u201d \u201cOkay, as expected. Let\u2019s go talk to Hunnicut\u2019s exes. And we\u2019ll check, see when\u2019s the best time for a follow-up with her. Give me ten. I\u2019m going to talk to the victim\u2019s family, make sure everything jibes there and nothing jumps out.\u201d Eve spoke with the grieving parents. They hadn\u2019t known about the trip, the surprise. Knew no one who would harm their daughter\u2014no enemies, no resentful exes. They added little to the investigation but the weight of their grief. Eve carried it with her to the bullpen. \u201cWith me, Peabody. In the field, Jenkinson. Albright\u2019s parents didn\u2019t know about the trip,\u201d Eve continued as she strode to the elevators. \u201cSaid they would have contributed to the cost of the tickets if they had. But she told them how she was going to reveal a big surprise, and would send them pictures.\u201d \u201cShe wanted Shauna to know first,\u201d Peabody concluded. \u201cIt was Shauna\u2019s big dream, so Shauna first.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my read.\u201d Eve took one look at the packed elevator when the doors opened, turned on her heel, and headed for the glides. \u201cThe father insists it had to be a mugging, a robbery, because no one who knew his daughter would kill her.\u201d \u201cIt has to be easier believing that. If it can be easier.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d say, right now, nothing makes it easier. Marcus Stillwater first,\u201d Eve said as they continued down. \u201cFordam Publishing\u2019s closest. His apartment\u2019s only a block or two from there.\u201d \u201cStillwater\u2014bootie buddy, right?\u201d \u201cI guess that\u2019s one way of putting it.\u201d \u201cI never really had one of those. Did you?\u201d As they angled down the steps to the garage level, Eve glanced back. \u201cWhy would I want one of those?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, for the easy, no-strings, no-worries sex with someone you know and like.\u201d \u201cAnd how often do you figure that really works out?\u201d Frowning, Peabody got in the car. \u201cI don\u2019t know, since I never had a bootie buddy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d guess one in, oh, a hundred\u2014at best. Sex gets complicated if it\u2019s more than a one-off.\u201d Eve swung out of the garage. \u201cWhat do you do when your BB shows up at the door and you\u2019re naked with someone else? Or your BB decides they want more after all, or they want no more from you? Or you\u2019re the one who wants more than the buddy system and they don\u2019t? Maybe you get involved with somebody else, and your BB thinks, that\u2019s messing up my easy sex, and finds ways to screw with you?\u201d Peabody considered. \u201cYou know, I used to think it was too bad I never had a bootie buddy. Now I\u2019m thinking I was lucky I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cBounce naked on somebody, be ready for complications.\u201d \u201cI guess that\u2019s a good rule of thumb.\u201d \u201cWhose thumb?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Peabody decided. \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cThen give me the rundown on Stillwater.\u201d \u201cMarcus Stillwater, age twenty-eight. Originally from Virginia, went to NYU. Employed at Fordam for six years. No marriages, no cohabs. Got a bump\u2014indecent exposure, underage drinking, public lewdness. All one incident. At age nineteen he and a couple pals got loaded at a party, and took a dare to run naked around the track. Got busted.\u201d \u201cIs that it?\u201d \u201cOn the criminal, yeah. Got degrees in communication and in public relations. One sib, female, age twenty-four, still lives in Virginia.\u201d When she couldn\u2019t even find a loading zone on the street, Eve pulled into a shabby little lot, snarled at the obscene hourly price. \u201cRoarke should buy up all the parking lots in the entire city. He\u2019d double his already ridiculous fortune.\u201d \u201cHow do you know he hasn\u2019t?\u201d That gave her a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cNo. He\u2019d do something like have the scanner read my plate. Wouldn\u2019t he? Or maybe he has, and he\u2019s messing with me. \u2018Well now, Lieutenant,\u2019\u201d she said in a reasonable approximation of an Irish accent as she got out of the car, \u201c\u2018you had only to ask.\u2019 Then he\u2019d say something about how I actually own this one and that one, just to screw with my head.\u201d Then she shook it off. \u201cBut no. Crap parking lots aren\u2019t challenging enough for him to bother with.\u201d The heat had already set in so the air itself seemed to sweat. Sunlight bounced off steel and window glass and lasered the eyes, making her glad she\u2019d somehow managed to hang on to her kick-ass sunshades. When they reached the steel and glass that held Fordam, the wide auto doors slid open. Inside the busy lobby, the temperature dropped easily thirty degrees. \u201cWhy do they do that? Why do they take it down to meat locker?\u201d Now she found herself grateful for her jacket as they crossed the black-veined white tile floor. People walked purposefully or wandered dressed in business suits, business casual, or tourist-special tees and shorts. The lobby, ringed with caf\u00e9s, delis, and shops and centered with a burbling fountain, echoed with voices. Eve cut across to the security station, palmed her badge. \u201cMarcus Stillwater, Fordam Publishing.\u201d \u201cGot that for you,\u201d said the oddly cheerful blonde working the station. \u201cIf I could just scan your badge?\u201d She aimed a handheld, then blinked\u2014and her oddly cheerful smile bumped up a couple more degrees. \u201cWelcome, Lieutenant, to Houston Street Tower. Fordam Publishing is on floors twenty-eight, twenty-nine, and thirty. We have Mr. Stillwater on twenty-nine. Bank B, elevators one through three. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cMaybe not all the parking lots in the city,\u201d Peabody speculated as they aimed for Bank B, \u201cbut it\u2019s a pretty good bet Roarke owns this building.\u201d \u201cYeah, another way he screws with my head.\u201d She shoved her hands into her pockets as she waited for an elevator. \u201cIf he keeps it up, pretty soon I won\u2019t be able to bitch at any doorman, desk clerk, or security guard.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s diabolical.\u201d Eve spared her a glance. \u201cYou think you\u2019re joking.\u201d She got on the elevator, ordered twenty-nine. The elevator smelled, very lightly, of citrus. And though several people got on, got off, got on, on the journey to the twenty-ninth floor, the air maintained that faint, fresh scent. Roarke class, she thought. It, too, was diabolical. The lobby on twenty-nine featured pale gray floors, cream-toned walls, a ribbon of windows overlooking downtown, and a sleek black counter manned by two people. Since one worked on a comp and spoke into a headset, Eve aimed for the other. A bright-eyed redhead who might have been old enough to buy a legal brew. \u201cGood morning, how can I help you today?\u201d \u201cMarcus Stillwater.\u201d \u201cLet me check for you. Oh, I\u2019m so sorry, Mr. Stillwater is currently in a meeting. Could I\u2014\u201d Eve flashed her badge. \u201cMaybe he could step out.\u201d \u201cOh! Oh my goodness! Let me just\u2014\u201d She jumped up and fled through a glass door to the right of the counter. Watching her go, making damn good time on skinny red heels, Eve rocked back and forth on her sturdy boots. \u201cWhat do you bet she, or somebody she knows well, had some trouble with the cops?\u201d \u201cNot taking that bet. She flew like a bird.\u201d \u201cPeople never say she flew like a shuttle\u2014faster than a bird. It\u2019s always a bird.\u201d As she waited, Eve took a look around the small lobby. A little waiting area with dark gray seats, a couple of tall green plants in black pots, a scatter of strange, splashy art. Two people in business suits came in, both with go-cups, and bounced numbers and statistics between them as they went through the glass door on the left of the counter. A man came through the other door. If he\u2019d had a jacket and tie, he\u2019d ditched them. His fitted dress shirt showed off good shoulders. He had a crop of loosely curled sun-streaked blond hair around a vid-star face. Perfect proportions, a subtle tan, arctic blue eyes, and a smile as bright and warm as a summer sun. He held out a hand. \u201cMarcus Stillwater. I\u2019m sorry, Dora didn\u2019t get your name.\u201d \u201cLieutenant Dallas, Detective Peabody.\u201d \u201cWell, Lieutenant, Detective, I\u2019m more than a little pressed today, but why don\u2019t we take a seat here for a few minutes?\u201d \u201cYour office would be better. Have you spoken with Shauna Hunnicut this morning?\u201d His smile wavered a little. \u201cNo, as I said, I\u2019m pressed today. Is she in trouble? I can\u2019t imagine it, not police trouble. Wait, wait. Last night was the party, wasn\u2019t it? Party at the D&D.\u201d Now he shook his head, laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me Shauna did the crazy and needs bail. I\u2019m going to say, good for her, and I can take care of that. I can send someone down asap to\u2014wherever. What did she do?\u201d \u201cMr. Stillwater, it\u2019s best if we speak in your office.\u201d Now the smile dropped completely and he gripped Eve\u2019s arm. \u201cIs she hurt?\u201d \u201cSir\u2014\u201d \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, tell me.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not hurt, she doesn\u2019t need bail. Erin Albright was murdered last night.\u201d Beneath the tan, he went pasty. \u201cIs this some sort of a sick joke?\u201d \u201cNo. If we could continue this in your office?\u201d \u201cI just\u2014\u201d He pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cHanna, let Bill and Tricia know I had an emergency.\u201d He led the way through the door, and, Eve noted, a maze with a pecking order. Cubes, take a turn, desks, small meeting rooms, another turn, offices. He stepped into one, waited, then closed the door behind Eve and Peabody. \u201cWhat happened? Tell me what happened. Sorry, sit. Should I tag Shauna? Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s alone. I can\u2014\u201d \u201cMr. Stillwater,\u201d Peabody interrupted, and gently touched his arm. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down?\u201d He dropped down behind a cluttered desk. \u201cI\u2019ve been so busy, I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019d tried to tag me. I turned off my \u2019link\u2014no distractions. God. What happened? What happened to Erin?\u201d \u201cShe was strangled.\u201d His hand lifted to his own throat. \u201cStrangled? Jesus Christ. Where was Shauna? You said Shauna wasn\u2019t hurt.\u201d \u201cShe wasn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t with Erin at the time of the attack.\u201d \u201cBut they were at the party. That was last night. I\u2019m sure of it now. How\u2014\u201d \u201cMr. Stillwater, where were you last night?\u201d The color that had begun to seep back into his face faded again. \u201cMe? I\u2014I\u2019m a suspect.\u201d \u201cThis is routine. It\u2019s helpful if you can provide that information.\u201d \u201cI need to take a breath. Breathe. Erin. They\u2019re getting married this weekend, did you know that? You must know that. Shauna and I have been friends for\u2026\u201d He held out his hands, composed himself. \u201cOkay. Okay. We worked late\u2014Bill, Tricia, Jorge, Liza, and me. Until, God, close to nine? Working on a major campaign. I think we logged out about nine, then everybody but Liza went for food and drinks\u2014she\u2019s got kids at home, Liza does. Little kids. We went to\u2014where the hell?\u201d Pausing, he pressed his fingers to his eyes. \u201cBojo\u2019s. We went to Bojo\u2019s, got something to eat, something to drink, went over the work, again. We were there until, I think, I think we were there until\u2014had to be after eleven, maybe close to eleven-thirty. I walked home from there\u2014turned off my \u2019link because Tricia was still batting ideas, and I know how that works. I wanted a decent night\u2019s sleep.\u201d \u201cWhat time did you get home?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Bojo\u2019s is about ten blocks from my apartment.\u201d \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you saw or spoke with Erin Albright?\u201d \u201cAh, maybe a couple weeks? I had drinks with them and Becca and Greg a couple weeks ago. They were full of wedding talk.\u201d \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had sex with Shauna?\u201d He leaned back in his chair, let out a long sigh. \u201cMaybe a week or two before she fell for Erin. Was that a surprise for me? Yeah. She\u2019d never dated a woman before. Did I expect it to last? Not really. But I was wrong. They had the deal, the real deal. \u201cBreathe,\u201d he reminded himself. \u201cShauna\u2019s my friend, my really good friend. I was happy for her, happy when I saw she had the real deal. And Erin, you had to like her.\u201d Pausing, he scrubbed at his face again. \u201cShe had so much\u2014what\u2019s the word? Verve. I\u2019d\u2019ve tried to get along with her even if I didn\u2019t, for Shauna. But I did like her.\u201d \u201cWho didn\u2019t?\u201d He lifted his hands. \u201cHonest to God, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d tell you in a heartbeat if I did.\u201d \u201cWhen did Erin tell you about the trip to Maui?\u201d He frowned. \u201cShauna\u2019s big dream thing? I guess I knew about that since Shauna and I became friends. The one-day-she\u2019d-honeymoon-in-Maui thing. I know they were saving to go, delayed honeymoon. Next year, maybe the year after.\u201d \u201cDid you ever visit Erin\u2019s art studio?\u201d \u201cYeah, a few times. Shauna loved showing off Erin\u2019s work. It\u2019s good\u2014at least to my eye. I actually bought one of her charcoal drawings for my apartment. And later, one of her paintings. I liked her, Lieutenant. I liked her. \u201cI really need to talk to Shauna, to go to Shauna.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s staying with Angie Decker.\u201d \u201cAngie \u2026 Right, right, I know Angie. Should I tag Angie? Is that better?\u201d \u201cIt might be.\u201d Eve got to her feet. \u201cThank you for your time, for your cooperation.\u201d Eve took out a card, laid it on his cluttered desk. \u201cIf you think of anything else, please contact either me or Detective Peabody.\u201d \u201cAll right.\u201d He looked down at the card, then up at Eve. \u201cThey were getting married Saturday. Shauna asked if I\u2019d help seat people. It doesn\u2019t feel real. It doesn\u2019t feel like it could be real.\u201d \u201cHe felt real,\u201d Peabody said when they\u2019d left. \u201cHe did, but I\u2019ve been in Bojo\u2019s. You could walk to the D&D inside fifteen minutes. Let\u2019s check the timing, Peabody. He\u2019s one of Shauna\u2019s good friends\u2014why wouldn\u2019t Albright trust him? It also feels as if he\u2019d be the perfect backup to Donna Fleschner.\u201d \n Chapter Six On the street, Eve strode toward the parking lot. Morning started to bleed into afternoon. \u201cGive me the rundown on the other ex who came up.\u201d \u201cJon Rierdon. He manages City Style Home Goods. Ooooh. Thirty, single, one cohab that lasted about eighteen months. No criminal. New York native. Moonlights as a piano player at Swank\u2014a piano bar downtown.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. You take Rierdon, I\u2019m taking the player. Wade Rajinski\u2014Crack got me his full name. Then together we\u2019ll follow up with Hunnicut.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go to a home goods store with me?\u201d \u201cIf I go with you, you\u2019ll drive me to kick your ass. I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not in the mood to kick my ass?\u201d Peabody did a quick dance shuffle. \u201cIt\u2019s my lucky day.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m always in the mood to kick your ass. I\u2019m not in the mood to be driven to do so by your drooling over light fixtures and table settings.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d Peabody decided. \u201cAnd bonus? I can drool without fear.\u201d \u201cGot cab fare?\u201d \u201cYeah, but I actually know this place. Just a couple stops on the subway from here.\u201d \u201cFine. Tag me when you\u2019re done.\u201d Eve stopped at the lot, reconsidered. \u201cI\u2019m leaving the car here. Rajinski\u2019s place is walking distance, and so\u2019s his employment. Personal trainer and yoga instructor.\u201d \u201cI bet he\u2019s pretty. Stillwater was pretty.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to drive me to kick your ass after all.\u201d \u201cNope. My ass is now a moving target.\u201d As she hustled off, Eve called after her, \u201cI\u2019ve got really good aim.\u201d But she walked in the opposite direction. She didn\u2019t mind the noonday heat, in fact preferred it to the fake, frigid air of the interiors. And she never really tired of walking New York. Even when it was filled with wilting, sweaty tourists. Plenty of them trudged along the sidewalk, happy to spend their money on overpriced souvenirs and scratchy T-shirts from stalls or pose for pictures with their red, shiny faces in front of a shop or by a waiting Rapid Cab. She\u2019d never been a tourist here, she realized. No, not even when she\u2019d had that first slice of New York pizza at the window counter. Nearly as far back as she could clearly remember, New York had been her destination, the badge her goal. And when she\u2019d finally been free to get there, New York was home. Her place, her city. She walked it now surrounded by all the sounds and smells. Honking horns, shouted insults, a distant siren, music thumping out of a car window, voices merging in a multitude of accents, languages. Soy dogs on the boil, crap coffee, a tangy sauce from a plate on a table at a sidewalk caf\u00e9. A recycler overdue for pickup, some lunching lady\u2019s high-dollar perfume. Every bit of it was just fine with her. She didn\u2019t have to keep an eye out for street thieves\u2014she had cop\u2019s eyes, so they stayed trained. But none crossed her path as she walked to Mind, Body, Spirit. She went inside, where it felt like a brisk March wind had blown in. Fast, pulsing music blew in with it. Lots of mirrors, she noted, and lots of shiny machines with people sweating and puffing on them. A good free-weight area with a couple of people pumping while admiring themselves in a mirrored wall. Lunch-hour warriors maybe, she thought, and walked to the check-in desk. The woman behind it had the proverbial brick shithouse build, and showed it off in skin shorts and a very inadequate sports bra. She had her hair done in many braids pulled up like a crown on the top of her head. A pirate ship rippled across the rock-hard sea of her abs. She folded small white towels and spoke on a headset. \u201cHold on,\u201d she said, then glanced at Eve. \u201cJust swipe your card, take any available locker.\u201d \u201cNot a member.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d She tapped the headset. \u201cGet back to you.\u201d Then stepped over. \u201cHelp ya? A tour of the facilities, a day pass? Summer special on memberships through Labor Day.\u201d Eve held up her badge. \u201cWade Rajinski?\u201d \u201cHa. Figured he\u2019d run into cops one day. Second level. He should be finishing up his yoga class.\u201d \u201cThanks.\u201d Then she leaned on the counter in a friendly way. \u201cWhy did you figure he\u2019d run into the cops?\u201d The woman shrugged rock-hard shoulders, like boulders over the rock-hard ab sea. \u201cToo smooth, too shiny. Gotta be something under the smooth and shine, right? Total player with the ladies. Got dinged there a time or three.\u201d \u201cDinged?\u201d \u201cThis one time, this woman came barreling in here. Wade, he\u2019s working with a client on the bench press and she flies right over. Me, I\u2019m surprised we got any glass left in here the way she was shrieking about how he bounced off her and bounced right onto her sister.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019d he handle that?\u201d \u201cSmooth.\u201d She glided a hand through the air. \u201cLike butter. Gets somebody to spot his client, then takes her into the consult room. About ten minutes later, she comes out, all flushed up and starry-eyed. Walked out with a smile on her face, and Wade, he comes out and finishes up the training session like nothing ever happened. \u201cSmooth.\u201d She shrugged again. \u201cWe lose a client now and then because of it, but management likes him because for every one we lose, he pulls in three more. Guy\u2019s got a magic cock.\u201d At Eve\u2019s lifted brows, the woman shrugged a third time. \u201cSure. I mean it\u2019s right there, just looking to oblige. I figure why not go ahead and use it if the mood strikes, before some woman gets pissed enough to whack it off. But me, I don\u2019t get emotional over a cock, right? Magic or not.\u201d \u201cGood policy.\u201d With that insight, Eve wove through the machines and took a set of curved stairs to the second floor. Through one set of glass doors, she saw about a dozen people wiggling hips more or less in unison, quick stepping to the right, then the left while an instructor faced them. One of those dance-the-pudge-away deals, she assumed. Since the instructor appeared to shout, and she imagined the music blasted, she gave the place credit for excellent soundproofing. Inside the next room a woman in a white gi led another dozen or so\u2014older, at or around the century mark to her eye\u2014through some tai chi. Rajinski held the third classroom. He wore black skin shorts and a black tank that showed off his attributes. It came as no surprise to her that twenty of the twenty-two students were female. While she watched, he bent fluidly into a split-legged, seated forward fold, golden muscles damp and rippling, golden hair shining. Shifted fluidly into cobbler, and a flow into boat pose. She couldn\u2019t fault his form as he finished up the floor poses and slid into savasana. Keeping an eye, Eve pulled out her \u2019link and contacted Angie Decker. On-screen, Angie\u2019s eyes welled with grief. \u201cLieutenant Dallas. Is there anything\u2026\u201d \u201cThe investigation\u2019s ongoing. My partner and I are conducting interviews. I\u2019d like to follow up with Ms. Hunnicut when it\u2019s convenient.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re at the\u2014the morgue now. Shauna\u2019s with Erin\u2019s parents. Dr. Morris is very kind, just as you said.\u201d \u201cYes, he is.\u201d In the classroom, Rajinski and his students moved into a cross-legged position, eyes closed, hands palms up on knees. \u201cBecca and Greg just left. Becca\u2019s going to get some of Shauna\u2019s things, and Greg\u2019s picking up some food, I think. Shauna\u2019s going to stay with me until \u2026 Well, as long as she needs. I think\u2014\u201d Angie swiped at her eyes. \u201cActually, I think the sooner the better if you need to talk to her again. Get it over with, and we can be there with her.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll come to your place, within the hour.\u201d \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll tell her. We\u2019re all just \u2026 It feels like sleepwalking today. She\u2019s coming out now. I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d Eve put the \u2019link away. Inside, Rajinski put his hands in prayer, bowed. Most began to roll up their mats, but two women made a beeline for him. Practice over, Eve thought, and went through the door. Quiet music\u2014bells, strings, flutes\u2014played under the chatter of people getting ready to move on with their day. The room smelled of patchouli with just a hint of sweat. The two women vied for Rajinski\u2019s attention with hair tossing, body brushing, arm stroking. He managed to smile at both of them and give Eve the flirt eye as she crossed the room. Smooth. \u201cWade Rajinski.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d His eyes, a soft sea green, fixed on her as if only she existed. \u201cHello.\u201d Eve held up her badge. \u201cLieutenant Dallas, NYPSD.\u201d Curiosity crept into his gaze, his voice. \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cYes, really. I\u2019d like to speak with you regarding an investigation.\u201d \u201cOf course. Jin, Lea, you\u2019ll have to excuse me. You have a perfect day, and remember, five minutes of meditation before sleep quiets the busy mind.\u201d They left, and Eve felt their looks of resentment burn into her back. \u201cNow, what can I do for you, Lieutenant? If you\u2019d like to sit, we have a small water bar on the main level.\u201d A water bar, she thought. Didn\u2019t it figure? \u201cThis is fine. You were at the Down and Dirty last night?\u201d \u201cYes, I was, for about an hour. I enjoy its raw, real vibe.\u201d \u201cWhile there did you engage with Erin Albright and/or Shauna Hunnicut?\u201d \u201cI engaged with a number of people\u2014that\u2019s part of the vibe. But let me think.\u201d He stepped over, took a rolled towel off a shelf, and dabbed at his face and neck. \u201cErin and Shauna, Erin and Shauna \u2026 Yes! I remember. The brides-to-be. Adorable, both of them. Their happiness just brimmed over. I enjoyed spending some time with their group. Such joy and energy.\u201d \u201cHad you met them, or any of their group, before last night?\u201d \u201cUnfortunately no.\u201d His smile flashed. \u201cBut I hope to meet a few of them again.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t meet Erin Albright again. She\u2019s in the morgue.\u201d The towel paused in its dabbing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d \u201cErin Albright was murdered last night, at the Down and Dirty.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s shocking. That\u2019s horrible.\u201d He tossed the towel in a wicker basket. \u201cNo, just no, the energy was joy, not violence. I have some sensitivity, and I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve felt something so dark.\u201d \u201cLooks like you missed it. What time did you leave the club?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but before midnight. Maybe eleven-forty-five, around. When did this horrible thing happen?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me where you went, what you did after leaving the club?\u201d \u201cOf course, if that\u2019s helpful. As I said, I enjoyed connecting with the women in the group, but\u2014 May I be frank?\u201d \u201cYou can be whoever you want if you answer the questions.\u201d That little sarcasm slid right over his golden head. \u201cA stop at the Down and Dirty usually results in a more intimate connection.\u201d \u201cYou go to pick someone out to have sex.\u201d \u201cAn intimacy of the moment,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI like women. I like sex. I like sex with women, and that intimacy of the moment. Life is for living.\u201d \u201cUntil you\u2019re murdered.\u201d \u201cExactly. No, I mean, it\u2019s horrible, but that\u2019s my point. Live full while you can.\u201d He looked blank a moment. \u201cWhere was I going with this? Oh yes, while I felt the possibility of a more intimate connection with some of the women in that group, the night was not the night for it. They were a group, they were celebrating. And while I feel marriage is a societal construct designed to restrict our natural freedom, they had joy. I took some contacts for a later connection, and left them to their joy.\u201d \u201cAnd what did you do, Wade, after that?\u201d \u201cAs I was still in the mood for the intimacy of the moment, I walked to Tango. It\u2019s not as raw and real as the Down and Dirty, but a little more polished, you could say. I felt a pull toward a lonely, lovely brunette, and bought her a drink. A Zombie. We talked\u2014she\u2019d had a recent bad breakup. We went back to her place and had that intimacy of the moment. Twice.\u201d He smiled then. \u201cShe no longer felt lonely when I left\u2014about two-thirty this morning.\u201d \u201cDid you get a name?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d He actually looked insulted. \u201cDaralee\u2014isn\u2019t that charming? She moved to New York six years ago from Decatur, Georgia. Her accent was delightful.\u201d \u201cLast name?\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t find last names necessary, but I can give you her address and her \u2019link number.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d He held up a finger, crossed over to a small gym bag, and took out his \u2019link. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, and read off the data. \u201cOkay. When you were at the Down and Dirty, did you notice anything that seemed off? Anyone who wasn\u2019t full of joy?\u201d \u201cNo. As I said, I have some sensitivity. I\u2019m not a full sensitive, but I do have just a touch extra. I\u2019m sure I would have noticed that. As right now, I feel this darkness inside.\u201d He focused on her, eyes full of warmth, sympathy, understanding. \u201cYou have such a demanding, stress-filled job where the dark lives. I offer private meditation practices. I\u2019d love to work with you, give you some peace.\u201d \u201cThanks. I have my own methods of working off stress.\u201d A touch of humor now, and the sexy oozing through as he laid a hand on her arm. \u201cI could help with that, too.\u201d He gave her biceps a quick squeeze, and his eyebrows lifted. \u201cSlim as a willow, but muscles like stone. That\u2019s surprising.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll be real surprised if you don\u2019t move your hand and I show you one of my ways to relieve stress.\u201d He lifted his hand, held them both up, and added an easy smile. \u201cI apologize. I\u2019m a touchy-feely.\u201d \u201cHuh. I sensed that. I must have some sensitivity, too. Thanks for your time and cooperation.\u201d \u201cLieutenant,\u201d he said as she started out, \u201cI didn\u2019t get your first name.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t find my first name necessary for this.\u201d With a mental eye roll, she kept going. The brick shithouse now worked some poor schmuck through a circuit on the machines. She gave Eve a once-over. \u201cNot flushed, not starry-eyed. Guess Wade struck out with you. But you didn\u2019t arrest him.\u201d \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d She paused a moment. \u201cHas he ever been violent, overly pushy?\u201d \u201cI gotta speak truth. Just no. You give him the back-off signal, he backs right off. There\u2019s plenty of others who want a ride on the magic cock, and he knows it. He\u2019s a dog, right, but he don\u2019t bite.\u201d \u201cYeah, I got that.\u201d Holding up a finger, Brick Shithouse turned to her client. \u201cOn the pad, Paulie. And give me twenty. I could help you bulk up,\u201d she said to Eve, \u201cput some muscle on.\u201d Amused, Eve stepped over to the weight rack, picked up a twenty-five, and did ten smooth biceps curls. \u201cMy mistake.\u201d \u201cA lot of people make it.\u201d Eve replaced the weight and walked out. As she walked back to the parking lot, Eve tagged Peabody. \u201cOn my way back to the car.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just leaving\u2014in a minute.\u201d \u201cThen meet me at Angie Decker\u2019s. They should be back from the morgue.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll head there. Any luck with Rajinski?\u201d \u201cGot an alibi to check, but it\u2019s going to. He\u2019s a horndog with not too many smarts and a magic cock. He\u2019s not our guy.\u201d \u201cHow do you know about the magic cock?\u201d \u201cI have it on good authority. And if you bought something in that place\u2014and you did\u2014I don\u2019t want to hear about it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just say it didn\u2019t interfere with or affect my interview. I wouldn\u2019t mind hearing more about the magic cock.\u201d \u201cGet to Decker\u2019s.\u201d She actively considered continuing the walk to Decker\u2019s, but had to admit she\u2019d waste time. And it proved the right decision when she found a parking spot half a block from the building. Pleased with her luck, she strolled down to a corner cart and ordered soy fries and a tube of Pepsi. \u201cYou\u2019re eating.\u201d Peabody, huffing just a little, stopped beside her. \u201cI had to wait for you, so it passed the time.\u201d \u201cVeggie dog,\u201d Peabody ordered. \u201cMustard, Diet Pepsi. Rierdon didn\u2019t ring bells,\u201d she told Eve. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t have an alibi. He\u2019s in a relationship\u2014two months in\u2014and the woman he\u2019s seeing teaches salsa on Monday nights. I confirmed. He grabbed takeaway, a gyro, on the way home, also confirmed. Got home about seven, had a beer.\u201d She took the dog, paid. \u201cThanks. Ate the gyro,\u201d she continued, \u201cwatched some screen, had another beer, and crashed by eleven.\u201d As they walked back, she munched on the dog. \u201cHe was up front. Shauna ended things before he was ready, so he was a little pissed and didn\u2019t want the whole we-can-be-friends deal Shauna did. Hasn\u2019t had a real relationship again until this one. He didn\u2019t know Erin Albright, but he\u2019d heard through mutual friends that Shauna was involved there, then engaged there. \u201cOne fry? Can I have one fry?\u201d Eve held out the scoop. \u201cOnly one,\u201d Peabody repeated, like a mantra. \u201cHe said\u2014and it came off true\u2014knowing she switched teams made him feel better about the breakup. Then he heard about the murder right after he opened the store this morning, and remembered the name. He said he started to text Shauna, then didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll verify, but if he didn\u2019t know the victim, it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019d bring him in on the big surprise.\u201d Eve stopped outside the building, a nicely rehabbed white brick, mixed commercial and residential with a Greek place\u2014coulda had a gyro\u2014and an upscale hair and nail salon street level. Eve walked to the maroon residential door, found Decker, and buzzed. A male voice answered, \u201c4202.\u201d \u201cLieutenant Dallas, Detective Peabody.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll buzz you in.\u201d When the buzzer sounded, Eve stepped in, studied the pair of elevators in the tiny entrance. Then pushed open the stairway door. \u201cI should\u2019ve had more than one fry.\u201d \u201cYou can skip any cardio you planned for later.\u201d Peabody brightened. \u201cGood trade. And we\u2019ve done some suspect eliminations.\u201d \u201cFirst-pass eliminations don\u2019t always stick.\u201d \u201cTrue, but these feel like they will.\u201d \u201cStairway\u2019s clean,\u201d Eve commented. \u201cAnd you hear that? The pretty much nothing? Solid soundproofing. Some baby\u2019s probably screaming somewhere in here, but we don\u2019t hear it. Solid building, nice neighborhood. Decker lives alone, she\u2019s still shy of thirty. She models, and also works for her family\u2019s business. They\u2019re plumbers.\u201d \u201cThat explains it.\u201d \u201cYeah, if you can fix a toilet on a weekend, you can charge two arms and one leg. One official cohab, male, lasted just over two years, ended last fall. If she\u2019s straight, it\u2019s unlikely she and the victim were involved in that way, but they might\u2019ve been.\u201d \u201cAre you looking at her?\u201d \u201cIf Albright needed a backup, why not the person she chose to stand up for her at her wedding? Statements indicate she was in the club area at TOD. But it wouldn\u2019t take long to do the deed and get back. You\u2019d need a way to ditch the weapon and the rest, but, if you planned it out, possible. She\u2019s tall enough, looks strong enough.\u201d Eve paused on the third floor. \u201cSay she and Erin had an on-and-off. Go back to booty buddies. Maybe even kept that on the down-low. Then Erin falls for Shauna. It doesn\u2019t pass or wear out like before. It sticks. Now they\u2019re getting married, and we cut to the classic \u2018If I can\u2019t have you, no one will.\u2019\u201d Eve started up the next flight. \u201cIt\u2019s a theory.\u201d \u201cYou wanted to follow up with her as much as Shauna.\u201d \u201cThey were tight. She was trusted. Gotta look.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she kill Shauna\u2014get rid of the obstacle?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that thing people say? How you always strangle the ones you love.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s \u2018hurt.\u2019\u201d \u201cI bet getting strangled hurts.\u201d \u201cEither way, I get it.\u201d \u201cKeep it in mind while we talk to them.\u201d \u201cI will. But now I wish I hadn\u2019t liked her right off. The way she and DiNuzio flanked Hunnicut, the way the three of them held together like a unit.\u201d \u201cAnd all that might be true. But somebody Albright knew and trusted killed her.\u201d On four they walked to the apartment. Good locks, Eve noted, a door cam with intercom. The door opened before she could knock. The male voice, she assumed. He came in just over six feet, about a hundred and seventy, a leanly muscled build in black pants, a pale-blue-and-gray pin-striped dress shirt open at the collar, rolled to the elbows. Caucasian, and another vid-star handsome with a clean-shaven angular face, short, wavy brown hair and deep-set, deep brown eyes shadowed with fatigue. \u201cLieutenant, Detective, please come in. I\u2019m Greg, Greg Barney. We\u2019re \u2026 we\u2019re all in the living room.\u201d He led them down a short entrance hall into a spacious living area with large windows offering a street view. Shauna sat on a cream-colored couch, a rose-colored pillow pressed to her middle with one arm. Her other hand clung to Donna Fleschner\u2019s. \u201cThey said I could come,\u201d Donna said quickly. \u201cI wanted to come.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Eve told her. Angie rose from the facing love seat, stepped to the side. \u201cPlease come in, sit down. I was going to make coffee, but no one wanted any. I can make coffee.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d As she crossed the room, Eve gauged the tableau. Stylish furniture\u2014muted backdrop with bold splashes of color. Some of the art on the wall had to be Erin Albright\u2019s; even Eve recognized the style. Becca sat on the arm of the sofa on Shauna\u2019s other side. Shauna, ghost pale, her red hair pulled back and rolled into a knot at the base of her neck. She wore a black dress, one a bit too big on her. Greg stood, his hands going in and out of his pockets as if they didn\u2019t know where to settle. \u201cI went by the deli. I\u2019ve got lunch meat and sides. Shauna, let me make you a sandwich.\u201d \u201cNot now, Greg. Not now.\u201d \u201cYou need to eat,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI got the pastrami you like. I\u2019ll make you a sandwich.\u201d She just shook her head. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d Becca rose, went over to take his hand. \u201cSit, babe. Stop hovering and sit.\u201d She nudged him into a chair, then sat on that arm with a hand on his shoulder. Shauna let out a long sigh. \u201cNobody knows exactly what to do right now. We all had something to do before. We needed to go see Erin. We went to see her in that place. And Erin\u2019s parents. We all went to see her, and Mr.\u2014I mean Dr.\u2026 I can\u2019t remember his name, but he was very, very kind. But you know how people say at a funeral or memorial, how she looks like she\u2019s sleeping?\u201d Shauna\u2019s hollow, bruised eyes met Eve\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s not true. She didn\u2019t look like she does when she\u2019s asleep. It\u2019s not true.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Eve said, \u201cit\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cErin\u2019s mom and dad\u2014I thought they should plan the memorial. I thought that was the right thing. But they wanted me to have a part of that, and I asked if we could have our wedding flowers and some of the music. I thought Erin would want that. I don\u2019t know. Everybody thought so, too, but I don\u2019t know for sure. Do you think that\u2019s the right thing?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cI think it\u2019s exactly the right thing.\u201d \u201cIt feels like the right thing, but nothing really feels right. I can\u2019t imagine it ever will.\u201d \u201cMs. Hunnicut\u2014\u201d \u201cShauna.\u201d \u201cShauna,\u201d Eve corrected. \u201cYou have a lot of support here, and that\u2019s going to be a tremendous help. But we\u2019re going to give you the name of a grief counselor.\u201d \u201cAll right. But what if I don\u2019t want to let go of that? What if I don\u2019t want to stop the grief?\u201d \u201cThen they\u2014and your friends\u2014will help you live with the grief. And when we find the person responsible, that will help you live with it.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll still be gone.\u201d \u201cNothing can change that. If you were gone, and Erin was here, what would she want?\u201d Shauna took a breath, straightened her shoulders. \u201cShe\u2019d want you to find the son of a bitch.\u201d \n Chapter Seven \u201cShauna, can you think of anyone Erin was previously involved with who might have harbored a grudge against her, or you?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t. I really can\u2019t.\u201d She looked toward Angie. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t, either. Erin was what I think of as a flitter. She flitted, you know?\u201d \u201cDid she flit with anyone who was there last night?\u201d Angie blew out a breath. \u201cWell, yeah, some. Wanda Rogan, ChiChi Lopez. But not close to serious on anyone\u2019s part. Erin didn\u2019t do serious relationships. That\u2019s why Shauna was such a surprise. A really good one,\u201d she added. Angie shifted toward Eve. \u201cI met Shauna at Erin\u2019s art show, and I\u2019ve known Erin for a long time, so I saw it. The spark. I even said something to her. I said something like: \u2018Erin, you\u2019re wearing your dream eyes, and isn\u2019t she straight?\u2019 And she sighed, she actually sighed like you do when you\u2019re just gone over someone, and said: \u2018Passion\u2019s passion, love\u2019s love.\u2019 I honestly thought she\u2019d get her heart broken, and she told me if you don\u2019t risk heartbreak, you\u2019re not living. And she felt\u2026\u201d She trailed off as her voice thickened. \u201cShe felt like she\u2019d finally started living.\u201d \u201cShe said that?\u201d Shauna murmured. \u201cThat very first night?\u201d \u201cShe did. Glenda and I talked about it. We worried.\u201d \u201cGlenda Frost?\u201d Eve prompted. \u201cThe woman who runs the gallery?\u201d \u201cYeah. She loved Erin, as a person, as an artist. I let her know what happened, and she\u2019s heading back to New York today.\u201d \u201cBoth she and Donna missed the party. Was anyone else a no-show?\u201d Shauna pressed a hand to her temple. \u201cIt\u2019s all such a blur.\u201d \u201cKaydee couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d Becca spoke up. \u201cShe\u2019s an intern, doing an ER rotation. She tagged me about ten last night. Multi-vehicle accident, and they were taking the bulk of the injured.\u201d \u201cWhat hospital?\u201d \u201cMidtown West.\u201d \u201cAnyone else?\u201d \u201cNo. Angie and I did the guest list,\u201d Becca said. \u201cWe shared the parties\u2014this one and the shower last month\u2014though Erin and Shauna did most of the planning for last night. But I did a head count once things got rolling. I\u2019m kind of anal that way.\u201d Greg looked up, smiled at her. \u201cOnly that way?\u201d She just laughed a little and poked him. \u201cMaybe in a few others.\u201d \u201cDid anyone leave early? Anyone step out awhile and come back?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t notice anyone. Angie?\u201d \u201cNo, not that I noticed, either. Bathroom breaks\u2014but we went in twos or groups, like we already talked about. It\u2019s possible, I guess, but we weren\u2019t really that big a group. And between Becca and me, we know everyone. I\u2019d swear there was no one there who\u2019d do this.\u201d Greg started to push up from his chair. \u201cShauna, let me get you some tea.\u201d Becca nudged him back as Shauna shook her head. \u201cHovering,\u201d she murmured. When he only lifted his hands in a helpless gesture, Eve continued. \u201cWhat about your previous relationships, Shauna? Besides Marcus Stillwater and Jon Rierdon.\u201d \u201cI talked to Marcus this morning.\u201d Tears swam into her eyes, but she didn\u2019t shed them. \u201cHe\u2019s coming over as soon as he can get away from work. This is taking over your apartment, Angie.\u201d \u201cJust stop. It\u2019s yours, too, as long as you need it.\u201d \u201cI have to find another place. I can\u2019t live there now.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with that later,\u201d Becca told her. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to think about right now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d Donna put an arm around her. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready.\u201d \u201cAll right. Okay.\u201d Shauna took a moment to settle again. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Jon in I don\u2019t know how long. We didn\u2019t have a big fight; it just wasn\u2019t working for me. Last time I saw him, it\u2019s been several years easy, I guess. At Jodi\u2019s party, right, Bec?\u201d \u201cYeah, he was there. He brought a smoker.\u201d Shauna managed a smile. \u201cShe was, wasn\u2019t she? I came solo\u2014I think that soothed his ego some. He has a pretty big one. Anyway, I dated some after Jon and before Erin, but nobody serious. And before Jon\u2014are we going back that far?\u201d \u201cDetails matter.\u201d \u201cWell, there was Simon Pugh. I had such a crush on him. He didn\u2019t have one on me.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t like him,\u201d Becca muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t I know it. We dated for about three months. Me exclusively, him not so much. Then he dumped me.\u201d \u201cWall Street guy,\u201d Becca filled in. \u201cFull of himself. It was a meet-cute, shared cab.\u201d \u201cHe was a little bit of a prick,\u201d Greg commented, and Shauna managed a weak smile. \u201cHe really was. And I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019s given me a thought since he dumped me. I dated in college, but that was mostly party time and, we\u2019ll say, passions of the moment. If we\u2019re still going back?\u201d She gestured toward Greg. \u201cHigh school.\u201d \u201cShaunbar.\u201d He sent her a look of affection. \u201cWe were The Couple in high school.\u201d \u201cGood times.\u201d \u201cGood times,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThen the emotional parting for college. You cried buckets.\u201d \u201cI did.\u201d The memory made her smile a little more. \u201cThen I got over it.\u201d \u201cYou did. And all of that netted me the grand prize.\u201d \u201cAww,\u201d Becca cooed when he took her hand and kissed it. \u201cWe all knew each other in high school\u2014I think I mentioned that. They were The Couple, and I was The Very Serious Student.\u201d \u201cHonor society, class valedictorian,\u201d Shauna continued. \u201cWheeze.\u201d \u201cProudly. Then Shauna and I reconnected\u2014or just really connected\u2014and when Greg moved to New York, we had a kind of mini-reunion. That wasn\u2019t long before the cab ride with Snobby Simon. We had a double date. Well, Greg and I weren\u2019t really dating, more hanging. Now that I think about it, it was our mutual dislike of Simon Pugh that springboarded us into really dating.\u201d \u201cDo we have to thank him for it?\u201d Greg wondered. \u201cNah.\u201d \u201cYou make me happy.\u201d Shauna spoke softly. \u201cSeeing the two of you together always makes me happy.\u201d \u201cWhere were you last night?\u2019 Eve asked Greg, and his eyes widened. \u201cWow. I guess I walked into that one.\u201d \u201cOh, Lieutenant, Greg would never\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Shauna. Seriously, I get it. And thorough\u2019s important. I manage On Trend. A downtown men\u2019s shop. Since Becca was going out, I took closing last night. I\u2019d say I was out of there about seven, seven-fifteen. I walked over to Tippler\u2019s, met a friend for a beer and some bar food. Clint Wetz. He\u2019s with Jodi of the party fame. She\u2019d have been at the party last night. I guess we were at Tippler\u2019s a couple hours. Clint called it because he had a breakfast meeting today, and since it was a nice night, I walked home.\u201d \u201cYou bought me flowers,\u201d Becca reminded him. \u201cTiger lilies.\u201d \u201cRight, how could I forget? A stall still open on the way home. Came home, put them in some water. I figured to watch some screen, and crashed on the living room sofa. I don\u2019t know what time, but before eleven. I was streaming \u2026 what the hell was it?\u201d He shut his eyes as if to think back, then with a shake of his head, opened them again. \u201cSorry, some science fiction thing, aliens. I just went out, and was out until Becca tagged me about Erin.\u201d \u201cHe wanted to come.\u201d Becca rubbed Greg\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut I said no. I didn\u2019t know how long we\u2019d be, and I\u2019d stay with Shauna, how she\u2019d need him more today.\u201d \u201cOkay. Thanks, that covers it. We\u2019ll get out of your way. Detective Peabody will send you a list of grief counselors. When you\u2019ve scheduled Erin\u2019s memorial service, please let us know.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t there something else?\u201d Shauna asked. \u201cAnything else?\u201d \u201cErin\u2019s our priority. You can be sure of that.\u201d \u201cI want you to tell me whenever you know something, or think something. I want you to ask me whatever you need to ask me whenever you need to ask. I want what Erin would want if she was sitting here and I was gone. I want you to catch the son of a bitch.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re working for.\u201d When they stepped out, Peabody glanced back. \u201cNot everyone has that much real support. If she\u2019s lucky on any level, she\u2019s lucky there. The intern checks out,\u201d she added as they started down the stairs. \u201cShe was on until after one A.M. And Glenda Frost\u2019s shuttle should be landing in New York right about now. She booked the flight just after nine this morning.\u201d \u201cDo a deeper dive on no-alibi Rierdon. And we\u2019ll take a look at Rogan and Lopez. Could be one of them was more serious than Erin.\u201d \u201cI wonder how I\u2019d feel if McNab hung around someone he\u2019d flitted with.\u201d \u201cYou flitted around with Charles and hang around with him now.\u201d \u201cDid not! I flitted around the flitting with Charles, but we didn\u2019t actively flit. Ever. Maybe I let McNab think we actively flitted, but he was being a jerk.\u201d Then she shrugged. \u201cAnd I was being a jerk, but we worked all that out. You actively flitted with Webster.\u201d \u201cOne bang is not a flit. Add I didn\u2019t hang out with Webster. He was on the job, that\u2019s work.\u201d \u201cAnd now he\u2019s living off-planet with Darcia, and Charles and Louise are married. Life rocks and rolls.\u201d \u201cAnd some flit their way through it.\u201d Eve stepped outside, put on her sunshades. \u201cGreg Barney and Becca DiNuzio\u2019s address?\u201d Peabody pulled out her PPC to look it up. \u201cGotta take a look at half The Couple from high school.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. Shauna would trust him, no question. Can\u2019t say if Erin would have, but we\u2019ll take a look. No alibi for the time in question, so we look.\u201d \u201cAnd given his address, he could\u2019ve made it work.\u201d \u201cPlug it in,\u201d Eve ordered, and got in the car. \u201cPlus, who\u2019s to say when he picked up the flowers, or where? I mean, that\u2019s a pretty good add, right? I bought flowers on the way home. But he could\u2019ve bought them after he killed Albright, or earlier in the day.\u201d Digging into it, Peabody sat back. \u201cSay, on his lunch hour, and since he lives close to work, he runs them home.\u201d \u201cDiNuzio would\u2019ve seen them when she got home, changed for party time.\u201d \u201cRight, right. But not if he tucked them away somewhere. Or brought them back to work in a bag, like they were something else.\u201d \u201cHow long do flowers last without water?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re crushing my buzz. Okay, so he could\u2019ve bought them on the way home\u2014the idea hits. Buy the flowers, establish my innocent steps. Or he buys them after the kill. Or! He buys them going to or from the art studio when he gets the case. Hell, he could\u2019ve ordered them for evening delivery. How would we trace tiger lilies already in a vase?\u201d \u201cWhile I appreciate your mind working in cynical ways, delivery would be stupid. If you can\u2019t find flowers\u2014and it\u2019s New York, it\u2019s summer, you\u2019re going to find some stall with flowers\u2014you pick up something else. Something for cash. Most likely, he bought them exactly as he said. Either because he\u2019s telling the truth all around, or because he wanted the little extra flourish as cover.\u201d Peabody slumped a little. \u201cSure, if you want it to make more sense. We had The Couple in high school. Lauren Beals and Denny Parker. Why do I remember that? Is it sick I remember that?\u201d \u201cYour call.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit sick,\u201d Peabody decided after some thought. \u201cNot pathological though. Okay, so running through the theory that Greg Barney did the deed, motive. He still has it for Shauna, Becca\u2019s just the beard. She doesn\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure of that one. He\u2019s hooked up with her so he stays close to Shauna. Then what! She\u2019s going for somebody else!\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s dated and had sex with somebody else\u2014multiple somebodies.\u201d \u201cBut now she\u2019s getting married.\u201d \u201cPoint for you on that. There\u2019s the men\u2019s shop. And that puts his place between it and Crack\u2019s. A solid walk to the D&D, we\u2019re going to time that just to tie it down.\u201d Peabody went back to her PPC. \u201cAnd the bar where he met the friend? Two blocks north from \u2026 here.\u201d Eve hit vertical and dropped into a second-level street slot. Peabody swallowed her heart out of her throat, back into her chest. \u201cYou never warn me. You just never, ever warn me.\u201d \u201cSaves you anxiety time. Let\u2019s take a walk.\u201d \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d \u201cThe bar.\u201d Eve jogged down the steps to street level. \u201cGiven the location, I\u2019m betting Barney\u2019s at least a semi-regular. Meanwhile, pin down the friend, see if he verifies.\u201d And, she thought as they walked in the steamy air, they needed to talk to Erin\u2019s friends and flit partners. While Peabody worked her \u2019link, Eve imagined the walk after dark. Still traffic, sure, vehicles, pedestrians. But not as many people clipping or trudging along after dark. Cooler air, closed shops. A block north, they hit a flower stall. And Peabody clicked off her \u2019link. \u201cChecks out. They met where and when. Or by seven-thirty. The alibi says they left together around nine-thirty. Confirmed breakfast meeting this morning.\u201d \u201cWe still start at the bar. Any of those tiger lilies?\u201d \u201cYeah, three bunches right there. Boy, they\u2019re really pretty.\u201d \u201cKeep walking.\u201d \u201cHe probably got them there. Why wouldn\u2019t he? He\u2019d walk right by them. So either a sweet gesture or a clever ploy. He did seem kind of sweet. Like stopping by a deli so there\u2019d be something easy to eat. And I have to add Becca strikes me as a woman who\u2019d know if she was just the beard.\u201d \u201cMaybe, but we play it out.\u201d Since the bar was open, Eve walked in. Tippler\u2019s smelled of beer and bar food\u2014not unpleasantly. It had a decent crowd taking advantage of both. Eve went to the bar, caught the attention of the bartender, a woman with a pink froth of hair and excellent breasts displayed in a low-cut, skintight black tee. \u201cWhat\u2019ll it be, ladies?\u201d Eve palmed the badge discreetly. The bartender shook her head. \u201cShould\u2019ve caught that. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d \u201cWho was on the stick last night, about seven-thirty to ten?\u201d \u201cThat would be me. Usually off at eight, but had to cover.\u201d Now Eve held up a screen shot of Greg\u2019s ID picture. \u201cGreg? Come on, man, he can\u2019t be in cop trouble.\u201d \u201cJust verifying he was here last night.\u201d \u201cYeah, with his pal what\u2019s-his-name. Give me a sec. Yeah, Clint. Couple of beers, loaded nachos. Their ladies were having a girl party. Greg comes in with his now and then. Pretty blond\u2014that reddish blond type. They call it strawberry, but strawberries are red-red, so I don\u2019t get that.\u201d Right there with you, Eve thought, but asked, \u201cWhen did they leave?\u201d \u201cHell, hard to pin that down, but not late. I\u2019m going to say before ten for sure. Friend wanted an early night. Greg toyed with hanging for one more beer, but decided to cash out and leave with the friend. Is that it?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it. Thanks.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy,\u201d the bartender added. \u201cYou can tell a good guy by how he treats his lady\u2014or his guy, whichever. And he\u2019ll ask how you\u2019re doing and mean it. Tips decent.\u201d \u201cGood to know.\u201d Eve stepped away. \u201cTime it,\u201d she told Peabody. \u201cSteady walk, we pause at the stall, then steady walk to the apartment building.\u201d \u201cOn your mark. He wouldn\u2019t have to dodge and weave so much on the walk at going on ten.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll be close enough. We\u2019re going to take a look at the two women Erin flitted with who were at the party. Odds are she trusted them.\u201d \u201cBecause she flitted with them?\u201d \u201cBecause she stayed friendly with them, friendly enough to invite them to the girl party. Pause.\u201d Since they paused at the flower stall, Eve talked to the vendor. \u201cHow late are you open?\u201d \u201cTen to ten, every day from May to October.\u201d He hit mid-sixties, Eve thought, neat as a parlor in a short-sleeved shirt and well-pressed khakis. He wore a blue fielder\u2019s cap with a white daisy over a grizzled buzz cut, and metal-framed sunshades. \u201cYou work the stall that late?\u201d \u201cOh, not me, honey.\u201d He smiled so sweetly, she didn\u2019t bite him for the honey. \u201cMy son comes on, takes over \u2019bout three most days. He brings a fresh supply in if we need it.\u201d Once again, Eve showed Greg\u2019s ID shot. \u201cYou recognize him?\u201d \u201cI sure do. He stops by, buys some of our pretties for his woman. Nice young fella.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what we hear, thanks. That\u2019s about how long it should\u2019ve taken him to buy flowers,\u201d Eve decided as they continued to walk. They waited at the corner for the Walk signal. \u201cI\u2019m starting to lose that buzz. Bartenders like him, flower vendors like him.\u201d Peabody shook her head. \u201cAll those women like him.\u201d \u201cAnd of course, likable people never kill anybody.\u201d \u201cWell, they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d They crossed the street in the pedestrian stream. \u201cI could see it more if it had been in the moment. Like\u2014crime of passion. It gets harder to see when you know it was planned out\u2014and planned on a night when they were celebrating.\u201d \u201cWhoever killed her knew what was in the case. They\u2019d have looked. Why wouldn\u2019t they? Definitely not trustworthy when you\u2019re going to garrote the bride. It\u2019s a fairly slick kill. Stupid part was wasting time taking the jewelry, leaving the case. No half-blind cop would look at the scene and think mugging. And he should\u2019ve taken the case\u2014in fact never picked up the case in the first place.\u201d \u201cShit, when did he pick it up?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the backup\u2014she told Donna she had backup, so he already knew about the case, the whole deal. Erin would have told him Donna had to be in Baltimore. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she dropped off the case to him herself. Or told him where to find a spare swipe. Then Donna heads out of town, Erin tags him. Plan B. It\u2019s his opening.\u201d \u201cIf Donna\u2019s sister hadn\u2019t gone into labor\u2014\u201d \u201cShe did. Fact. We stick with that, for now. Here\u2019s the building. Time.\u201d \u201cTwelve minutes, forty seconds, including the flower stop.\u201d \u201cIf he\u2019d rushed, he\u2019d have cut that time. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d need to.\u201d She stood, studying the building. \u201cWhat floor are they on?\u201d \u201cSecond.\u201d \u201cOne of those post-Urban toss ups\u2014no cams, crap security, soundproofing\u2019s going to be crap, too. If he\u2019s smart, he makes some noise going in, maybe gets someone to notice. Gets in the apartment, takes care of the flowers, changes out of his work clothes. Checks what\u2019s on-screen. Turns it on. Not too loud, just loud enough. Get the case, the weapon, gloves, the swipe for the privacy room. If she\u2019d let him in the back, she\u2019d just take the case and go. So he\u2019s in the room. He\u2019d dump the swipes to the studio\u2014if he had them\u2014in her purse after she\u2019s dead.\u201d \u201cYou really like him for it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just running it through. You want to be quiet leaving, you want to be sure you\u2019re not seen now. Gotta take your time\u2014it\u2019s too early anyway. And you\u2019ve gotta get your guts up. Yeah, you\u2019d have to get your guts up.\u201d Eve shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot over a high school deal. And that\u2019s what, nearly ten years back?\u201d \u201cMy buzz is dead on it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll finish it out. Time.\u201d Eve started to walk again. \u201cOn the street, you\u2019re just some guy carrying a case, and it\u2019s raining\u2014more cover. Or just finished raining, depending. But it\u2019s damp, steamy. You\u2019re sweating. Could change your mind, just deliver the case. What\u2019s driving you, after ten fucking years?\u201d \u201cOkay, so maybe the fire went out, after high school. Good times, fond memories, and all that. Reconnect, and maybe the spark with Becca was real, but as you go, that fire starts up again.\u201d \u201cHow long have they been together, him and Becca?\u201d Peabody pulled out her notes. \u201cOfficial cohabbing two years, three months.\u201d \u201cLong time to fake it.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut play it out. What killed the spark and started the fire? Shit, it\u2019s stupid.\u201d But she kept walking as the neighborhood got seedier. \u201cNo logic to it. Nearly there though, so we go around the block and into the back.\u201d Once they had, Eve said, \u201cTime.\u201d \u201cSixteen minutes, twelve seconds.\u201d \u201cHave to give him opportunity. Definitely had opportunity, but motive is stupid weak, means is questionable.\u201d Still, she broke the crime scene seal and mastered in. Play it through. \u201cI\u2019m going to say, coming in this way, getting into the privacy room quick and unseen, he\u2019s likely been here before. Scoped it out. He\u2019s already got the swipe.\u201d With a nod of agreement, Eve shut her eyes. \u201cBacktrack a minute. She\u2019s got a morning cleaning job, and she swings in here after that, before she heads home, or to the studio or wherever. Crack gives her the swipe\u2014around noon, he said. She meets her backup, passes it off because Donna\u2019s in Baltimore and might not make it. Gives backup the swipe to the studio. And here comes opportunity.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she just bring the case herself, get the swipe, stow it?\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t or Crack would\u2019ve noticed it, so \u2026 Had to be a time factor\u2014time factor passing off the swipe to her backup.\u201d Noontime, she thought. Lunch hour? \u201cWe\u2019ll check on the timing, cleaning job, location. But this is how it went down. The backup, and let\u2019s keep Barney in the lead for now, comes in the back, goes straight to the privacy room.\u201d In the silent club still smelling faintly of sweepers\u2019 dust, Eve started toward it. \u201cSomebody sees him? Recognizes him? He can just scratch the kill, play up the secret. But nobody does.\u201d She mimed swiping into the unsecured privacy room. \u201cIt only takes a few seconds to come in, swipe in, get inside.\u201d With Peabody, she stepped inside, closed the door. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think to secure it after the kill. Nervous, probably nervous, a little shock. This was likely a first kill. \u201cCan you do it, can you really do this?\u201d The room held little more than a bed. Blood had coagulated on the floor, and stained the air. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have given the backup a specific time,\u201d Peabody commented. \u201cHow could she know exactly when she\u2019d be able to slip away without Shauna noticing?\u201d \u201cBallpark. She wants the party in full swing, wants this to be like the big deal that pumps it forward. Can\u2019t ask her, but he can\u2019t just drop it off because he has the swipe, and she needs it back. No other reason for her to want him to stay, or ask him to stay.\u201d \u201cNo place to hide in here,\u201d Peabody pointed out. \u201cShe had to see him as soon as she opened the door.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. She\u2019s a little drunk, a lot happy, and probably doesn\u2019t think twice. Stand right there.\u201d Eve stepped out, then in again. \u201cShe sees him, and happy, a little impaired, excited, says something. \u2018Oh, you\u2019re here. Thanks for doing this!\u2019 Turns, shuts the door. And he\u2019s on her. Get on me.\u201d Peabody moved forward, cupped her hands around Eve\u2019s throat to mimic the garrote. \u201cPain, shock. Drops her purse. She can\u2019t scream, but claws at the wire. Bam! He bashes her head against the door, and now she\u2019s blacking out, choking, terrified. Helpless. Struggling, but helpless. Goes down right here, loses a shoe.\u201d After signaling Peabody back, Eve turned. \u201cHe takes her \u2019link out of the purse. But he can\u2019t take just that, has to take it because there\u2019s communication on it, but he takes her jewelry, her cash, dumps the swipes. Takes the weapon and gets out the way he came.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long. Probably under five minutes. He may have waited for her longer,\u201d Peabody added, \u201cbut this part was really quick.\u201d \u201cOpportunity knocked.\u201d She opened the door again. \u201cWe\u2019ll head back to Central. See if you can reach Wanda Rogan, ChiChi Lopez, and bring them to us. I\u2019ll let Crack know he can open tomorrow\u2014after he gets a crime scene cleaner in here.\u201d \u201cGreg Barney? Is he still top of the list?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll keep him up there with Rierdon, do those deeper dives. Motivation\u2019s weak and stupid on both, but with some, love can be both.\u201d \n Chapter Eight When she got back to Homicide, Santiago and Carmichael sat at their desks. Jenkinson, his tie, and Reineke didn\u2019t sit at theirs. \u201cThey\u2019re following a lead on the cold one,\u201d Baxter told her. \u201cGood enough. Peabody, give the vic\u2019s two former flitters another push. If we can\u2019t get them in here, we\u2019ll go to them.\u201d She went to her office, hit the AC for coffee. After taking her desk and writing up the interviews, she updated her board. She stood studying it, then turned when Peabody came to her door. \u201cRogan can be here in about thirty. I left another v-mail for Lopez.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s take her in the lounge. We\u2019ll keep it friendly, sympathetic, so you take the lead. You interviewed her last night, so she\u2019s already got that connection.\u201d \u201cCheck.\u201d Peabody glanced at the board. \u201cA lot of overlap. Everyone on there\u2019s connected to either Albright or Hunnicut, or both. And a lot of them are linked to each other.\u201d \u201cFriendships can be incestuous.\u201d \u201cI guess you could think about it that way.\u201d \u201cEspecially when you add the sexual component. The flitting, the banging, the one-offs. Before Albright, all of Hunnicut\u2019s flitting and banging partners were male. As far as we know, all of Albright\u2019s were female.\u201d \u201cI get that, but does it apply?\u201d \u201cEverything applies at this stage, Peabody. The killer could be male, female, gay, straight, bi. But this was personal. The method, cruel and cowardly, but the location, the timing\u2014even counting for opportunity knocking\u2014it\u2019s deeply personal. Someone she knew and trusted, under a week before the wedding, when she\u2019s surrounded by friends, when she\u2019s planning to surprise the woman she loves by fulfilling a dream. \u201cIt was fucking personal.\u201d \u201cA friend, a former lover. Someone on the board.\u201d \u201cSomeone on the board,\u201d Eve agreed. \u201cOr someone nobody\u2019s thought to mention yet. And I don\u2019t give that much weight. Dive into Rierdon. I\u2019ll take Barney.\u201d \u201cOn it. I\u2019ll let you know when Rogan gets here.\u201d Eve sat, started that dive. Gregory Barney, age twenty-seven, New York native, New York resident. Parents: Cynthia and Walter Barney, married twenty-nine years\u2014thirty in another month. He had two sibs, both female, both younger at twenty-five and twenty-three. From what she read, he\u2019d had a solid if average middle-class upbringing. No particular religious affiliations, no criminal but a standard arrest and release at a college protest when he\u2019d been nineteen. He\u2019d played football in middle school, then in high school, but hadn\u2019t taken that with him to college. Solid grades but for some problems in advanced math classes. She could relate. He\u2019d done four years at the University of Florida, switching his major after one semester from sociology to business management. He\u2019d moved back to New York after graduation, lived with his parents for a few months while working in retail. Moved into Manhattan from Brooklyn. Got his own place, with a male roommate until he worked his way up to assistant manager, then took an apartment on his own. He\u2019d stuck, she noted, with On Trend, and that had worked out for him, as he\u2019d gotten regular promotions and raises. For the past three years, he\u2019d lived in his current apartment, and for some months over two, cohabbing with Becca DiNuzio. No sign of gambling or wild purchases in his financials that she could see. He lived within his means\u2014on the edge from time to time, but never over it. He didn\u2019t own a vehicle or any real property, traveled once or twice a year\u2014beaches and resorts. Eve sat back. Average, she thought. Ordinary. Not that the average and ordinary type didn\u2019t kill. But trying to tie a murder to the average and ordinary over a high school romance just didn\u2019t play out. Until she added the new and trusted factors. Which, she admitted, applied to nearly everyone currently on her board. Peabody came back. \u201cWanda Rogan\u2019s here. I\u2019ll take her down to the lounge. I\u2019ll send you what I have on Jon Rierdon, but it\u2019s not much of anything.\u201d \u201cYeah, I got the same on Barney.\u201d She pushed away from her desk. \u201cWe\u2019ll take her down, see if we get more than not much.\u201d When Wanda rose from the waiting bench outside the bullpen, Eve judged her at about the same height as Erin. More muscular with a gym-fit body in wide-legged white pants, a crisp red shirt. She had chocolate-brown hair liberally streaked with blond worn in a long fall of waves around a heart-shaped face dominated by large brown eyes. Under them spread the shadows of a hard night. \u201cMs. Rogan, thank you for coming in. I\u2019m Lieutenant Dallas.\u201d \u201cYes, I know.\u201d Her voice brought on images of smoky rooms and saxophones. \u201cI saw you last night. I don\u2019t know what I can do to help, but I want to help. I loved Erin, and over the last year, I grew to like Shauna so much.\u201d \u201cUnderstood. Why don\u2019t we talk in our lounge?\u201d Eve gestured, led the way. \u201cI haven\u2019t contacted Shauna today. Didn\u2019t know if I should. I know she went with Angie, and I assume Becca\u2019s with her. I\u2014I know Erin\u2019s family, but didn\u2019t want to intrude. I just don\u2019t know the right thing to do.\u201d \u201cI think offering comfort and support is always the right thing,\u201d Peabody told her. \u201cThat\u2019s what I felt from you and the others last night. An openness to offer comfort and support.\u201d \u201cWe all know Erin and Shauna, and each other. Some better than others, but we all have that link. I still can\u2019t believe this happened, is happening.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a seat?\u201d Peabody chose a table. \u201cCan we get you something to drink?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t risk the coffee,\u201d Eve told her. \u201cYou want something that comes in a tube.\u201d \u201cIs there iced tea?\u201d \u201cIced tea. Detective?\u201d \u201cWater, thanks.\u201d Since she wanted Peabody in the lead, Eve crossed over to Vending. And now had to face the damn machine. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me today,\u201d she muttered, and punched in her code. \u201cWelcome, Baxter, Detective David. Your code is verified and you are free to make your selections.\u201d \u201cFine, whatever.\u201d She programmed for the iced tea, the water, and went for a Pepsi. \u201cPlease be advised, your selections of Summer Time Iced Tea and Pepsi both contain artificial flavorings and chemical additives.\u201d \u201cOh, bite me,\u201d Eve muttered as the machine listed them. \u201cEnjoy your selections, Baxter, Detective David. Your account has been charged.\u201d \u201cGreat.\u201d She walked back to the table where Peabody softballed the interview. \u201cSo you and Erin met shortly after you moved to New York.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. I was just twenty. I came into a small inheritance\u2014my great-grandfather\u2014and dropped out of college, moved here. I was going to make my mark, and make it in New York. I rented a dump of a furnished apartment so small I had to crawl over the Murphy bed if I had it down to get to the bathroom. That didn\u2019t have a sink. The only sink was in the corner of the living room that claimed to be a kitchen. I loved it.\u201d \u201cYou moved from Kansas.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right, a little dot on the map in very rural Kansas. Not much opportunity to make my mark as a singer\u2014the superstar I imagined. Add gay in a loving but very traditional family. I wanted bright lights, I wanted New York.\u201d \u201cYeah, me, too. Free-Ager family.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re great, but I wanted New York, and they got behind me on it. How did you meet Erin?\u201d \u201cAbout a year later\u2014I was waitressing, going to auditions, discouraged. But I got a gig at a caf\u00e9 in SoHo, and she was there. She bought me a drink after. She was a struggling artist, I was a struggling performer. Friendship came first.\u201d Wanda cracked the tube, but didn\u2019t drink. \u201cI loved her art\u2014I couldn\u2019t afford it, but I loved it. She did a painting of me onstage in this red dress I\u2019d bought at a secondhand shop, and gave it to me for Christmas that year. I met Donna and Angie and Margo. It was so good to have a group, you know?\u201d \u201cA tribe.\u201d Lifting her hands, Wanda folded them together, gesturing with them toward Peabody as she smiled. \u201cYes, exactly that. I hated waiting tables, but the gigs wouldn\u2019t pay the bills. Angie suggested I try selling real estate. So I took an online course, got my license. Now that pays the bills, and gives me enough flexibility to take more gigs.\u201d She looked at Eve. \u201cI know your husband\u2014not personally, just know. I haven\u2019t sold him anything\u2014I\u2019m small-time. But anyone in my business knows Roarke. So I feel I know you, both of you, the same way. That\u2019s why as horrible as this is, I feel Erin\u2019s in good hands.\u201d The big brown eyes went teary as she sipped her iced tea. \u201cI need to believe that. I don\u2019t think I could get through this if I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cLosing a friend is crushing,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cWere you and Erin ever more than that? Did you have a romantic relationship?\u201d \u201cOh, briefly, but I wouldn\u2019t say romantic. It was more, we\u2019re both at loose ends, we like each other, we\u2019re healthy young lesbians, so why not? And it was nice, but \u2026 I guess I brought some of my traditional background with me. We didn\u2019t really click that way. Sexually, sure, but the friendship meant more, on both sides. And I wanted\u2014still want\u2014what she had with Shauna. I want that real bond, that real love, that promise of forever. That wasn\u2019t Erin for me, or me for Erin. So friends it was.\u201d \u201cDid she trust you?\u201d Eve asked. \u201cYes.\u201d A slight frown crossed Wanda\u2019s face. \u201cI mean, I hope so. I think she did. I certainly trusted her.\u201d \u201cWith secrets?\u201d \u201cIf I had one, I\u2019d trust her to keep it. If she had any and shared with me, I wouldn\u2019t tell you unless I thought it would help find who killed her. No, I\u2019ll tell you this one,\u201d Wanda corrected. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt. They weren\u2019t going to have a band or a professional DJ at the wedding\u2014they were saving for a big honeymoon down the road. Their parents would have kicked in, but they\u2019re not rolling in it, either, and had already contributed. Erin asked me if I\u2019d sing, maybe talk some of the musicians I knew into coming\u2014for the free food and drink. Just do one set maybe. Especially the first dance\u2014they\u2019d planned a recording for that. She was going to surprise Shauna.\u201d Wanda dashed a tear away. \u201cThen Shauna came to me with an almost identical request. Could I sing them down the aisle, maybe do the first dance. She didn\u2019t want me to work the whole wedding and reception, but wanted to surprise Erin.\u201d She dug out a tissue. \u201cGod. I didn\u2019t tell either one of them about the other, and like I said, I know Erin\u2019s family. I know Shauna\u2019s now a little. I told them, so we put it together behind the scenes, you know?\u201d \u201cThat was a beautiful thing to do, each of them, the families, you.\u201d Reaching over, Peabody laid a hand on Wanda\u2019s. \u201cDid she tell you about the surprise for Erin she planned for last night?\u201d Drying her eyes, Wanda shook her head. \u201cNo. What surprise?\u201d \u201cDid you know she\u2019d sold some paintings recently? Studio work, not street.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I mean not in the last few weeks. I\u2019ve been slammed. Lucky enough to get some good evening and night gigs, showings and meetings at my day job. And we\u2019ve been squeezing in rehearsals for the wedding. I haven\u2019t talked to Erin much in the last two or three weeks.\u201d Now she blinked tears away, shoved back her hair. \u201cAnd she and Shauna were busy with the wedding plans, plans for last night. What surprise?\u201d she asked again. \u201cShe took the money from the sale of the paintings, got a little boost from her moonlighting jobs. She bought tickets to Maui, booked a hotel.\u201d Wanda stared at Eve before the tears rolled. \u201cOh, oh, that\u2019s so Erin. That\u2019s just so Erin.\u201d \u201cShe had someone bring in her weekend case,\u201d Peabody continued. \u201cShe had a costume\u2014grass skirt, coconut bra, leis.\u201d Wanda pressed both hands to her mouth. \u201cEven more like Erin. That\u2019s just what she\u2019d do, just what she\u2019d do. Big surprise, big fun, big splash. Giving Shauna something she\u2019d only dreamed of, and share it with all of us. That\u2019s who she was. That\u2019s Erin.\u201d \u201cWho would she have trusted to keep the secret, to bring in that case?\u201d \u201cI\u2014any of us, I think. Angie, Donna, me, a dozen others. Erin was so open. She trusted and loved her friends. Her tribe,\u201d she said to Peabody. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t ask you.\u201d \u201cNo. I would\u2019ve done it. I would\u2019ve been happy to. But, I guess, she\u2019d already asked me for something, and \u2026 spread it out. I didn\u2019t think this could get harder, but now it is.\u201d Struggling for composure, she turned to Eve. \u201cDid you ask Angie? Angie\u2019s so efficient, she could\u2019ve asked her. Except\u2014\u201d \u201cExcept.\u201d \u201cBecca and Angie did the shower, and I know they helped at least some with the party last night. Spread it out,\u201d she repeated. \u201cDonna\u2014wait, Donna had to go to Baltimore. Her sister went into labor. Donna didn\u2019t make the party.\u201d \u201cWho else comes to mind?\u201d Eve pressed. \u201cHonestly, they\u2019re first, or me, then it could be anyone. Well, I\u2019d eliminate a couple who have a hard time not either blurting out a secret or who can\u2019t help but act like they have one. Why, is it important?\u201d \u201cEverything\u2019s important,\u201d Eve told her. They spent a little more time, pushing for details, for answers and memories, but couldn\u2019t pull out more. When Peabody walked Wanda out, Eve sat another moment. Not only did Wanda\u2019s statements ring true, she simply didn\u2019t ring. Probably strong enough, Eve considered as she started back. Maybe tall enough in heels. But the rest? It didn\u2019t play through. She met Peabody outside the bullpen. \u201cI bought it,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cAll of it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay for it, but no, she just doesn\u2019t fit. She knew the victim for what, six, seven years. Tried on the sex, didn\u2019t click, stayed friends. Let\u2019s check out the sing-at-the-wedding deal, but that plays, and it weighs on the no side of things. \u201cMaybe she could\u2019ve snuck the case in, maybe she\u2019s strong enough. The height\u2019s off, but heels would compensate. She\u2019d still have to get back in the room, wait or follow the target in\u2014and the crime scene reads already inside to me. Then do the kill, take the \u2019link, the jewelry, stow that where nobody notices.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re more looking at the exes, at least the ones we have.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m more looking at somebody who came from outside. I want to go over McNab\u2019s interviews with the people there who weren\u2019t with the group. Whoever did this likely walked out that back door, but maybe someone left a table, didn\u2019t come back.\u201d \u201cI can go over that with him. Listen, Dallas, we\u2019re eliminating suspects from the group that was there. That\u2019s going to narrow it down. Unless it was some conspiracy and two or three of them planned this out together.\u201d \u201cNo, two people can rarely keep a secret. Three? Forget it. And add murder? Not this one. Solo kill, solo planner, most probable. Known and trusted, and those are key factors. I\u2019m going to write this up. You work with McNab, or if he\u2019s busy, take his interviews and do \u2019link follow-ups. Just take another pass.\u201d She saw Jenkinson back at his desk, and the way he scowled at his desk screen concluded the lead hadn\u2019t panned out. \u201cYou can clock out after you\u2019re done, Peabody. I\u2019m going to head back to the D&D, talk to Crack, since he\u2019s too stubborn to hire a crime scene crew. His place, he deals with it. Then I\u2019ll track down ChiChi Lopez.\u201d \u201cGo now. I\u2019ll write it up. I had the lead,\u201d Peabody reminded her. \u201cRight, you did.\u201d She stuck a hand in her pocket. \u201cWhere\u2019d I put the damn sunshades?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re in your car.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re in the car. I want to take the gallery owner tomorrow morning. Glenda Frost. She\u2019s not a suspect, but she may know something.\u201d \u201cI can set that up.\u201d \u201cDo that, let me know. I\u2019m in the field.\u201d Since the elevator that opened as she passed disgorged cops, then stood empty, she chanced it and nipped inside. She had a few floors of thinking time where she decided, on the Eve Dallas probability scale, it hit ninety-eight percent the killer brought the case in the back door and straight into the privacy room. She\u2019d go with a solid seventy-six the killer came from outside the group until she added the trust factor. There\u2019d been a couple dozen people, give or take, the victim would\u2019ve trusted in that group. So lower that to sixty-five. When the elevator began to stop and fill, stop and go, she pushed off for the glides and took her calculations with her. She went back to ninety-eight percent the killer was already in the room when Erin Albright came in. Back turned, head bashed against the door. But that didn\u2019t change the in-or-out-of-the-group calculation. The timing worked for Greg Barney\u2014as did the lack of solid alibi. Same with Jon Rierdon. And they might find more. Rierdon fell out with the trust factor. Why would Erin trust him? Unknown factor, but her gut took him well down on her list. As for Barney? Why bring him into it when you had that group, that tribe? Not bumping him down yet, she thought as she reached the garage level. He and Becca, planning it together? Some resentments simmering all the way back to high school? It happened, she decided, and drove out of the garage into traffic. The wheeze and the rejected boyfriend. It could play. More logical to target Shauna herself, but \u2026 more painful to kill someone she loved, and leave her grieving. She played with that angle, picked it apart, put it back together as she drove to the Down and Dirty. A very doable walk, she thought again as she hunted up parking, from so many of the apartments, workplaces, hangouts of this intersecting group of friends. Not surprising. Geography counted. It counted again when she had to walk two and a half blocks from parking to the club. The vibe started to change as it crept closer to the end of the workday, or passed that mark for some. Not as many tourists on the street now, or at least not here where the sex clubs, the bars, the piercing and tat parlors ruled. She watched two women come out of one of those parlors. One had skin still pink under a vine of weird flowers now twining up her arm. And her face as pale as chalk. A trio of guys in work boots and sweaty shirts trooped into a bar. End-of-construction-day brews. She spotted a junkie across the street, jittery as he hunted up an early score. And ignored him. The neon on the D&D stayed dark and the front windows shaded. She mastered in. Rochelle Pickering, tall and built in worn jeans and a faded T-shirt, stood scrubbing at the bar. She\u2019d bundled her black corkscrew hair under a floral do-rag. She jolted when Eve stepped in, then blew out a breath. \u201cYou startled me. I didn\u2019t expect anyone to come in.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to find you cleaning the bar.\u201d \u201cWilson won\u2019t let me near the room where it happened, so I\u2019m helping this way. Nobody got to clean the place afterward last night. It\u2019s terrible, what happened. He\u2019s just sick about it.\u201d She went back to scrubbing, putting some elbow grease into it as she spoke. \u201cHe told me he knew her, that she came in off and on, and for a long time. And how they were having their bachelorette party here, she and her fianc\u00e9e getting married in a few days. He\u2019s just heartsick, and won\u2019t have anyone deal with that room but himself.\u201d \u201cSometimes it helps, to do it yourself.\u201d \u201cI know, and I\u2019m hoping it does.\u201d She put down the rag a moment, turned to Eve. \u201cI was hoping to talk to you sometime\u2014I wish it wasn\u2019t after this. But I wanted you to know how well Dorian\u2019s doing at An Didean. The counseling\u2019s helped her deal with everything that happened to her, back to her mother\u2019s emotional and physical abuse, through the nightmare of what was done to her at that vicious so-called Academy.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more than good, Dallas. She\u2019s got a lot more counseling in her future, but she\u2019s actually blossoming. She\u2019s so much smarter than her grades at her school before she ran away indicate. Her mother simply didn\u2019t allow her to blossom, and now she is. She\u2019s making friends\u2014carefully, but making them. And the boy, Mouser\u2014Tom? He\u2019s just a wonder. So damn entertaining, and not just smart, Dallas. Scary smart. He just latches on. \u201cYou helped give them this chance, and I wanted you to know what it means.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it. They both got knocked around more than any kid should. Roarke put you in charge of the school because he knew you\u2019d find ways to not only give them a chance but convince them to take it. \u201cSeen much of Sebastian?\u201d Rochelle smiled. \u201cI understand your issues with him, and why you have them. I don\u2019t disagree. He does check in with them from time to time, and I promise you, they need that connection. He helped them\u2014in his way, but he helped them.\u201d \u201cHis way is \u2026 questionable.\u201d \u201cAgreed, but right now, with these two children, I\u2019m seeing that blossoming. Without him, without you, without the school, I doubt they\u2019d have survived long, much less bloomed.\u201d Hard to argue, Eve thought, especially since she\u2019d been through her own nightmare of a childhood, and had had no one but herself. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to hear it. I\u2019ll check on Crack.\u201d She went back, found him on his hands and knees, a bucket by his side, a scrub brush in his big hands. Sweatpants, a ragged tee, and another do-rag\u2014not floral, but ink black. He glanced up at Eve. \u201cThat dust shit you cops use is bad enough, but the blood\u2019s worse. Been at this damn near an hour.\u201d \u201cLooks like you got it to me.\u201d \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d Still, he scrubbed a little more before he tossed the brush in the bucket. \u201cI can still see her though. It\u2019ll take more than some scrubbing to wipe that away.\u201d He rose, and she stepped aside to let him out, then followed him down to the men\u2019s john. When he dumped the bucket in the sink, the water came out nearly clear. She imagined he\u2019d dumped countless others running from red to pink. \u201cMaybe give it one more pass.\u201d \u201cCrack, let it be. You\u2019ve done what had to be done. I\u2019m betting that floor\u2019s cleaner now than it\u2019s been in years.\u201d He smiled a little. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Down and Dirty. But I keep the floors clean enough. You got shit to tell me, skinny white girl?\u201d \u201cI can tell you some shit, big, buff Black man. Buy me a Pepsi.\u201d \u201cI can do that.\u201d He carted the bucket with him into the club area, then stopped and shook his head. \u201cRo, you keep cleaning, none of my customers are gonna recognize the place, and walk right out again.\u201d He crossed over, took the bucket and rag from her. \u201cSit on down here with Dallas. We\u2019ve got us a private party.\u201d But Rochelle shot him a worried look as he went in the back. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Eve told her. \u201cHe can open again tomorrow, and that\u2019ll help him get it back.\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019re right.\u201d She took a stool when he came back. \u201cI\u2019m having a drink,\u201d he said, and pointed at Rochelle. \u201cYou\u2019re having a drink. You still on duty?\u201d \u201cI am.\u201d \u201cGirl.\u201d Shaking his head, he poured her a Pepsi on ice in a sparkling clean glass. Then pulled a bottle of wine from under the bar, poured a glass for Rochelle, tapped a beer for himself. \u201cHere\u2019s to fucking justice. You get it for her, Dallas. You get that fucking justice for Erin.\u201d \u201cWorking on it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me. What do you know?\u201d \u201cI know the person who was supposed to bring the case for her had to go to Baltimore. Her sister went into labor. It checks out. So Erin had to use a backup. I don\u2019t know who yet.\u201d She ran through what she had, at least what she had that she felt she could share with him. \u201cThat\u2019s more than I expected, less than I wished for. I wished you\u2019d gotten the bastard, but I expected it would take you time. I expected not to know too much today.\u201d \u201cDo you really think one of her friends killed her?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Eve nodded at Rochelle. \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cThen that\u2019s what happened.\u201d Rochelle gave Eve a decisive nod. \u201cWhen they killed my brother, you knew right away he hadn\u2019t overdosed, hadn\u2019t lied to me about being clean. And you found out who did that to him, and why.\u201d She looked at Crack, laid a hand on his. \u201cShe\u2019ll do just that here, Wilson.\u201d \u201cI believe it. You held me like I was a baby when I cried over my sister. My baby girl\u2019s body. I\u2019ve got every reason in the world to trust you with this. Erin died in my place, while I was right here where I am now. And that\u2019s hard for me to take. You\u2019re going to see who did it pays. I believe it.\u201d \u201cAnything that comes to mind. Anything you thought of, remembered, since last night? Dynamics,\u201d Eve added. \u201cA look that didn\u2019t strike quite right. Someone slipping in and out. Anything.\u201d He downed some beer. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about much else since, and I got nothing. Just nothing. Pisses me off I got nothing but a bunch of women blowing off steam, having a hell of a good time, cutting it loose. I thought about how Erin came in early for the swipe. She didn\u2019t tell me why, just she had something planned for Shauna, and could she have it now.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI figured sure, why not?\u201d \u201cMondays are slow.\u201d \u201cDamn slow, and since she\u2019d already booked it, I was going to keep it closed for her anyway. Tell you one thing.\u201d He pointed a finger at her. \u201cSoon as Roarke gets me the plan for cameras and such, they\u2019re going in. Ain\u2019t letting this happen again. No use me asking you to give me five minutes with who did this before you lock them up, especially in front of my lady, who wouldn\u2019t like it. But I wish for that, too.\u201d \u201cA cracked head or punch in the face heals,\u201d Eve told him. \u201cLife in a cage goes on and on.\u201d She pushed off her stool. \u201cI\u2019ve got somebody else to track down and talk to. Like I told you, you\u2019re cleared to open tomorrow.\u201d \u201cAnd we will.\u201d \u201cGood luck, Dallas,\u201d Rochelle called out. \u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d Eve said, and left. \n Chapter Nine A check of ChiChi Lopez\u2019s residence and workplace told Eve she\u2019d have a five-block trip there from the D&D, and about seven to Delights, the strip joint where Lopez earned her living. She considered the building traffic, the frustration of finding parking, and decided to walk it. Adding the time to her considerations, and when she could reasonably expect to finish up, drive uptown and home, she tagged Roarke as she walked. \u201cLieutenant, I see you\u2019re out and about.\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to be late. I\u2019m on my way to see a stripper.\u201d \u201cAnyone I know?\u201d She paused at the crosswalk with far too many others. \u201cJust how many strippers are in your acquaintance?\u201d \u201cWho counts? I\u2019m just leaving the office. Why don\u2019t I join you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying her residence first, so there may not be a show.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll risk it. Give me your destinations, and I\u2019ll head your way. The car can drop me off, and we can drive home together. Maybe I\u2019ll talk you into letting me take you to dinner.\u201d \u201cA handful of blocks from Crack\u2019s,\u201d she began, and reeled off the addresses. \u201cIn that order.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll find you.\u201d Yeah, she thought as she shoved her \u2019link back in her pocket, he would. They\u2019d found each other, after all, in a world of murder and mayhem. She watched a couple of street LCs grab a cart meal before they started their nightly stroll. A woman in micro shorts and a sports bra stepped out on a third-floor fire escape and watered a wilting pot of flowers. A skinny white cat with black markings sat on the windowsill and watched her. She passed a market with fruit stalls flanking the entrance. It smelled like summer. A guy in a backward fielder\u2019s cap sold knockoff designer wrist units at a sidewalk table. He had a couple of tourists on the hook. They\u2019d be better off with a sundial, but you lived and you learned. The after-work crowd began to flood the sidewalks, fast walking, talking on \u2019links, heading home or for drinks, an early meal. She passed a bar where happy hour spilled out to the sidewalk tables, and like the fire escape flowers, people wilted in the heat. More poured up or down the steps at subway stations. She turned a corner and watched a man in a business suit swooshing his way down the block on an airboard. She caught snatches of conversation. Frankie can fuck himself with a cactus. We need to lock down that account. My feet are killing me. Are you sure we\u2019re going the right way? Then turned once more and stopped at the first address. Surprised, she studied a townhome of painted white brick with a pot of flowers, not wilted, on the stoop. Three tidy stories with solid security and windows shining clean, it nestled between another set of townhomes and a Mexican restaurant called Abuela\u2019s with sidewalk service under a red-and-white-striped awning. ChiChi must be a hell of a stripper, Eve thought, and walked up to press the buzzer. Though the entrance had an intercom, there was no answer, not even from an annoying program. She gave it one more buzz, and a woman stepped out of the next door, leading a little rat dog. \u201cShe\u2019s not home.\u201d Eve stepped down, walked over to the woman with battleship-gray hair worn in a top bun. She wore a flowered dress over a body whittled down, to Eve\u2019s eye, by a solid eight decades. She had a face of sharp bones, golden skin, lively dark eyes, and bold red lips. Beside her the little rat dog sniffed at Eve\u2019s boots. Then yipped and yapped as if someone had kicked it in the ribs. It bounced like a spring. The woman snapped something at it in Spanish, and it sat, just staring at Eve with slightly crazed eyes. \u201cDo you know if Ms. Lopez would be at work?\u201d \u201cOf course she\u2019s at work! We earn a living in our family. This is about poor Erin. A sweet girl, an artist.\u201d The woman crossed herself. \u201cGod has welcomed her into his arms, but too soon for those who knew and loved her.\u201d Then she pointed a finger at Eve. \u201cI know police when I see police. What do you want with our ChiChi? I\u2019m her abuela.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re her grandmother?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t I say so? This is my place.\u201d She gestured to the restaurant. \u201cThe family business. But ChiChi, she has no skill for cooking, for this business. She has other skills.\u201d The abuela smiled. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. You knew Erin Albright?\u201d \u201cA good friend of my granddaughter, a friend of our family. Our priest will dedicate a mass to her. Why do you need to talk to ChiChi?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s routine, ma\u2019am.\u201d Now she wagged that finger back and forth. \u201cThe police say routine, but don\u2019t always mean it. So you talk to her, you go talk to ChiChi. There\u2019s evil in the world. It preys on the innocent and takes innocent lives. You know this already.\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cThen talk to ChiChi, but go find the evil. I have to walk my dog, then go to work.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Thank you.\u201d She stepped aside so the woman could lead her dog to the sidewalk. And continued on. She considered the encounter fascinating, and telling. The stripper shared a wall with her grandmother, and right next to the family restaurant. And that family had known, and apparently liked, Erin Albright. Would she have called on one of them for backup? Possible, she decided, and that opened up yet another avenue to explore. When she reached Delights, it didn\u2019t surprise her to see Roarke standing outside, under the sign of a well-endowed woman in a G-string and pasties, head tossed back as if in orgasm as she rode a pole. \u201cAnd there she is,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just about to tag you to see if I\u2019d guessed correctly or had a bit of a walk coming.\u201d \u201cYou guessed correctly. Lopez is at work. I talked to her grandmother, who lives in the townhouse next door. Do you know Abuela\u2019s, a Mexican place?\u201d \u201cI do, yes. A very well-run restaurant. Her grandmother\u2019s then?\u201d \u201cThe family\u2019s anyway. The grandmother says ChiChi\u2019s talents lie in another direction. She knew the victim.\u201d She scanned the exterior as she spoke. \u201cMore upscale than I expected. Not yours, is it?\u201d \u201cSadly no.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re faster. Check who owns the restaurant building, this one, and those townhouses.\u201d He took out his PPC, and had the answer in seconds. \u201cAren\u2019t you the clever one. Lopez Family LLC owns those properties, and a few more besides\u2014a few residential more.\u201d \u201cWith all that, I guess ChiChi just likes getting naked. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d Music thrummed. The lights held dim except on the circular stage, where a woman strolled and strutted in a three-piece suit and mile-high heels. She wore a fedora cocked on her head. Eve recognized the woman she\u2019d come to speak with. Plush red seats circled the stage, and for this early in the evening, Eve found them surprisingly full. More seats and booths lined the walls, and the bar in the rear did a brisk business. Servers in G-strings and pasties carried trays. Some of them had bills tucked into the G-string. A man in a corner booth enjoyed a lap dance, but his gaze stayed on the woman onstage rather than the one who serviced him. She didn\u2019t seem to mind. And Eve supposed ChiChi Lopez was something to see. She\u2019d stripped off her tie, shimmied/wiggled out of the suit jacket before doing a stylish turn on the pole. The vest came next, and more pole work. Eve had to admit the woman was flexible, and had a style. Even while she stayed fully dressed, patrons tossed bills on the stage. When the music hit a clash of brass, she tore open the breakaway dress shirt, revealing impressive breasts accented by tiny, sparkling pasties. More money flew when she tossed a leg up the pole, executing a standing split. By the time she yanked off the breakaway pants, the crowd buzzed and cheered. More cheers when she tossed away her hat, and black curls cascaded free. Eve figured her pole work in the tiny spangles reached gymnast level, maybe contortionist. Bumps, grinds, backbends, spins, and twirls, and Eve figured for about a ten-minute routine, she\u2019d pulled in easily two hundred in tips. Maybe three. At roughly six in the evening. \u201cEntertaining,\u201d Roarke commented. \u201cTake off your clothes and people toss money at you. It\u2019s weird.\u201d Since she\u2019d already made security\u2014the wide-shouldered man in the back in a black suit\u2014she walked his way. She held up her badge. \u201cLieutenant Dallas and civilian consultant, NYPSD. I need to speak with Ms. Lopez.\u201d \u201cAbout Erin? I\u2019m ChiChi\u2019s cousin. Our abuela let me know you were coming. Have a seat\u2014\u201d He pointed to a booth. \u201cDrinks on the house. I\u2019ll tell my cousin.\u201d When he walked off, Eve shook her head. \u201cMore weird. His cousin gets naked onstage, and he doesn\u2019t blink.\u201d \u201cJust a job of work, Eve.\u201d \u201cA job of work where the audience is getting boners over your cousin.\u201d \u201cPlenty of women in here as well.\u201d \u201cThey get the female equivalent of a boner.\u201d She took a seat in the booth. \u201cStick with water, okay? We\u2019re on the job.\u201d One of the nearly naked servers sidled up, gave Roarke a crystal clear eye fuck. \u201cJust water, please. Still.\u201d \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d She purred it. \u201cI\u2019m at your service.\u201d \u201cJesus,\u201d Eve muttered as she hip-rocked away. \u201cI\u2019m sitting right here.\u201d Roarke just smiled. \u201cSo tell me, why are we here about to interrogate a very talented stripper?\u201d \u201cInterview. The stripper was at the party, and at one time got naked with the victim.\u201d \u201cI see.\u201d \u201cThe victim had a friend lined up to bring the case\u2014with the costume, the tickets\u2014into the club. But that friend had to go to Baltimore\u2014sister in labor, blah blah\u2014that\u2019s confirmed, confirmed the friend never made the party at all. So Erin told the friend not to worry. She had backup.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re looking for the backup.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m looking for the backup,\u201d she agreed, and gave him the bare bones while the nearly naked server brought their water, and they waited for ChiChi. \u201cA lot of legwork today,\u201d Roarke concluded. \u201cYeah, some eliminations, some maybes, and now with the Lopez family, possibly some expansions. And here she comes.\u201d ChiChi had changed into a black skin suit, cut nearly to her waist in the front. She\u2019d left her hair down but had changed her stage heels for black sneakers. There, Eve gave her points for sense. She slid into the booth across from Eve and Roarke. \u201cCops can make our clientele nervous.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here making your clientele nervous if you\u2019d responded to my partner\u2019s v-mails.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d She shrugged as the server brought her sparkling water. \u201cI said everything I knew, which is nothing, last night. I lost a friend. I took a pill and went to bed, and stayed there until after noon. I had to tell my family, and they liked Erin a lot. Then I went to church with my abuela, and got ready for work.\u201d \u201cYou work an early shift,\u201d Eve noted. \u201cI\u2019d think the later crowd would bring in more.\u201d \u201cI bring in more.\u201d She tossed her hair. \u201cAnd I\u2019m done by ten.\u201d She shifted eyes very like her grandmother\u2019s to Roarke. \u201cIf you like redheads, Gia said to tell you she\u2019d give you the first lap dance free.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely offer, but I prefer lanky brunettes.\u201d \u201cYour choice.\u201d \u201cYou were involved with Erin at one time,\u201d Eve said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say involved. We took a spin a few times. I like sex\u2014not a crime. I like sex with men, with women, also not a crime. I liked sex with Erin. We had some fun, but we weren\u2019t looking to pick out china patterns. She met Shauna, and we stopped taking spins.\u201d \u201cHow did you feel about that?\u201d \u201cHow was I supposed to feel?\u201d She tossed back her waterfall of hair, gave Eve a cool, patronizing smile. \u201cLook around here. I could have my pick, but I keep sex and work separate. Maybe I didn\u2019t get what Erin\u2019s thing was with Shauna, but her life, right? \u201cUntil it wasn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cNot a fan of Shauna\u2019s?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s all right. If you go for boring and ordinary.\u201d With a shrug, she drank some water. \u201cI just didn\u2019t get it, that\u2019s all. Why she wanted this shoe store manager, this dead ordinary person, and the whole marriage thing.\u201d \u201cDid she know how you felt about it?\u201d \u201cShe knew I thought she was making a mistake, sure. I mean, hell, how long do you have to be young, and she locks herself in with one person before she\u2019s thirty? I didn\u2019t get it.\u201d \u201cBut you went last night.\u201d \u201cSure, why not? It\u2019s a party, and she\u2019s a friend of mine. Was.\u201d She paused, drank again. \u201cWas. And I thought, what the hell, they\u2019re having this deal at a place like the D&D? Maybe Shauna\u2019s not as dull as I figured. Anyway, she got trashed enough to get up there and strip down. No style to it, and not a lot of tits, but she was game. Gotta give her that.\u201d \u201cHave you spoken to anyone who was there last night since?\u201d \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t want to go over and over it. What\u2019s the point? She meant something to me. I thought she was wasting her life, then all of a sudden, she doesn\u2019t have a life to waste.\u201d \u201cHave you ever been to her art studio?\u201d \u201cSure. We were friends, so sure. Hell, I posed for her in there, then we rolled around on the floor. Did the same with the big guy. Anton.\u201d \u201cAnton Carver? So you had sex with him?\u201d \u201cOne round, after he sketched me. A couple rounds since. Why not?\u201d \u201cAfter Erin met Shauna?\u201d \u201cYeah, after. No big thing.\u201d \u201cDid you work here yesterday, before the party?\u201d \u201cI take Mondays off.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you run me through your day?\u201d \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d She set down her water with a pissy little slam. \u201cLook, I have to get ready for my next act.\u201d \u201cThen make it quick.\u201d \u201cI slept in. I went over to the restaurant for lunch, hung out with the family awhile, then went home. I\u2019m working on a fresh act. Worked on that, did some yoga, had some dinner, cleaned up, changed. I walked to the D&D, got there just before the storm hit. Maybe ten. \u201cIs that it?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019ll do for now. Thanks for your time.\u201d \u201cWe got lawyers in the family. If you want more, go through them.\u201d She pushed out of the booth and walked away. \u201cInteresting,\u201d Eve murmured, and pulled out a ten for the table. \u201cIt was,\u201d Roarke agreed. \u201cShe\u2019s very angry.\u201d \u201cTall and strong.\u201d Eve slid out of the booth, walked with Roarke to the door. \u201cEnough to fit. Angry, and she doesn\u2019t like Shauna.\u201d \u201cMore logical, wouldn\u2019t it be, to dispose of the one she doesn\u2019t like?\u201d \u201cNot if you\u2019re looking for payback.\u201d Outside, Eve started back the way she\u2019d come. \u201cErin cut off that part of their relationship, and she meant more than our stripper wants to admit. Revenge sex with Erin\u2019s studio mate, that\u2019s a tell.\u201d \u201cRevenge sex is a long way from murder.\u201d \u201cDating\u2019s a long way from marriage. In a little over a year, Erin and Shauna went from one to the other. Nearly got there. Maybe you think, all right, it\u2019s just a phase. It won\u2019t last. She\u2019ll get tired of this ordinary person and we\u2019ll pick things up where we left off. Then they\u2019re doing that\u2014what is it\u2014china pattern thing, and it hits, it\u2019s not just a phase. You won\u2019t be picking things up where you left off. She\u2019s rejected you and chosen someone else.\u201d \u201cAnd you think her outline of her day gives her plenty of room.\u201d \u201cPlenty of room to get the case, the swipes. Possible she had a swipe to the studio\u2014between sex rounds, posing. Plenty of room to get the case in there, then party, party, party. And try this.\u201d She paused at the corner, glanced over at him. \u201cShe keeps the privacy room swipe, tells Erin how she\u2019ll help her change for the big surprise. Good friend, lending a hand, so she slips into the room and waits.\u201d \u201cVery cold and calculating. She seemed more hot and angry.\u201d \u201cNow,\u201d Eve agreed. \u201cNow it\u2019s done, and she can\u2019t take it back.\u201d Eve gestured. \u201cThat\u2019s her place, grandmother next door, then the restaurant.\u201d \u201cAnd they also own the other townhouses there. Are you interested in tortillas for dinner?\u201d \u201cI thought about it, get a look at her family at work, but no. If it\u2019s her, it\u2019s her, not likely them. Plus, they look packed, so not a good time to try to squeeze out any information. \u201cI\u2019m parked a couple blocks from Crack\u2019s. I cleared him to open tomorrow. Rochelle was in there cleaning the bar. He did the crime scene himself. Wouldn\u2019t hire it out.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s his place. It\u2019s personal for him.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all personal with this one. I was in the victim\u2019s studio today, and saw some of her work. It looked good to me. She\u2019d done a painting of Polumbi\u2019s, the pizzeria where I had my first slice. Her artist friend\u2014the one who was in Baltimore\u2014said it was one of their hangouts. She got it, she really captured it. And she painted a figure at the window counter. It took me right back.\u201d He took her hand, kissed it. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go there now? I\u2019ll call ahead, get us a booth.\u201d She started to say no, they should just go home. Her board, her book, the case. \u201cYeah, let\u2019s do that. I could use that place, the pull back to that time, not to mention the pizza.\u201d It worked its magic, the smells, the light, the energy. She sat so she faced the front, and the memory. Roarke ordered a carafe of the house wine, and pizza. \u201cI did a lot of walking around New York today,\u201d she told him. \u201cDowntown anyway. And it struck me how much it\u2019s mine. And that painting \u2026 I\u2019d never felt what I felt when I sat on that stool at that counter looking out at the street. I never felt that freedom, and more, honest-to-God, like home. Mine. Never tasted anything half as wonderful as that first bite of pizza.\u201d \u201cWhenever I think of buying the place\u2014\u201d He held up a hand before she could object. \u201cWhenever I do, I understand no, no, it would change what it is for you if it was ours in that way. But you should buy the painting.\u201d \u201cI should buy the painting?\u201d \u201cIf her parents, or whoever\u2019s in charge, will sell it. I\u2019d buy it for you, but I think it\u2019s the same as buying this place. It wouldn\u2019t be the same. You should buy it for yourself.\u201d She hadn\u2019t thought of it, but now \u2026 \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s weird again.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He poured their wine when the server brought the carafe. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it, but first we find who killed her so she\u2019ll never paint another. So far, I\u2019m leaning toward exes. One of Erin\u2019s, two\u2014possibly three\u2014of Shauna\u2019s. You put an ex on somebody, no matter how it happens, there\u2019s a dig in there. A lot of times that dig keeps getting deeper instead of filling in.\u201d He listened while she ran it through, and when the pizza arrived, put a slice on her plate, then his. \u201cYou\u2019re leaning away from the bootie buddy.\u201d \u201cLeaning away, but not crossing off entirely. He doesn\u2019t feel right for it,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut again, Erin got in his way. When and if Shauna wants to pick things up again, he\u2019s right there.\u201d \u201cSex is powerful, but sex alone as a motive?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve got, so far. Weak, yeah.\u201d She lifted the slice, took a bite. And yes, it took her back, back to where everything was new and bright and, most of all, free. \u201cBut under sex is resentment, maybe a sense of betrayal. I sure as hell felt that from Lopez. \u2018You chose her over me? And now you ask me to help you give her this big deal? This dream? Screw that.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd Shauna\u2019s exes.\u201d \u201cStarts the same. Rejection, betrayal. Then wait a damn minute, now she\u2019s with a woman? What does that make me? Was she faking it with me? Pretending? Using me? Asking him to help with the surprise, that\u2019s both insult and opportunity.\u201d \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t target the one who rejected him.\u201d \u201cMaybe he still wants her. Maybe he wants to soothe his ego, maybe both. So remove the obstacle.\u201d She ate more pizza. \u201cStill weak, but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s not money, it\u2019s not some deep secret, I don\u2019t find envy. What I find is personal. Sex, passion, rejection, betrayal. Add making a mistake\u2014the way Lopez sees it. The timing, Roarke, days before the wedding, and at a party. That counts, too.\u201d She picked up her wine. \u201cEveryone I\u2019ve looked at? No major criminal, clean finances, no signs of gambling, addictions. They\u2019re a tight group, close in proximity, a tribe. Peabody calls the women a tribe. I guess that makes the male portions just outside that, but they connect, too.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t I take a closer look at the financials? Of the victim, her fianc\u00e9e, and your top suspects?\u201d \u201cIf you can\u2019t find anything there, it absolutely eliminates that as any sort of a motive.\u201d \u201cPlus, entertaining for me. You said her art was good.\u201d \u201cI thought so. So did Peabody. And apparently so does the woman who runs the gallery where she had a show, and sold the paintings that paid for Maui.\u201d \u201cHer art will likely be worth more now. Dead artist, it often follows.\u201d Eve\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s an angle. Some of this tribe has some of her art. And then the gallery. She didn\u2019t have a will. Most people her age, and in her financial bracket, don\u2019t bother. So do the paintings go to her parents\u2014next of kin\u2014or to Shauna?\u201d \u201cNext of kin would be the legal answer, I\u2019d think. Some sort of combination would likely be the emotional choice.\u201d \u201cYeah, they\u2019d probably work something out, and add some of her friends in, too.\u201d She went back to pizza. \u201cBut how much could it come to? And still,\u201d she added, \u201cpeople kill for less than whatever that may be. It\u2019s a good angle.\u201d \u201cHappy to oblige.\u201d Like in the painting, a waitress walked by with a tray. People ate slices, wound pasta, drank wine. \u201cWe need to find out who has any of her work. I know Angie Decker does. She\u2019s not hurting for cash\u2014unless I didn\u2019t find that in her financials. There\u2019s art in the vic\u2019s place she shared with Shauna. I don\u2019t see Shauna in this, but it\u2019s worth a look. Lopez posed for her, bound to have a piece or two. Stillwater told us he had a couple. And so did Wanda Rogan. And there were a hell of a lot of canvases in that studio\u2014with crappy security. Someone could walk in, take their pick. \u201cThis is an angle.\u201d And she felt the boost from it. \u201cMaybe money after all. Or sex and money\u2014always a top combo.\u201d \u201cI have a great deal of affection for both myself.\u201d She gave him a \u201cHa! That\u2019s no secret. You may have reached your quota of sex already today, since that busty server eye-fucked you twice.\u201d \u201cAnd yet, I don\u2019t feel satisfied.\u201d \u201cYou could\u2019ve had a free lap dance with a redhead.\u201d \u201cAnd yet,\u201d he said again, \u201chere I am, having pizza with my lanky brunette.\u201d \u201cIf redheads are redheads,\u201d she wondered, \u201cwhy aren\u2019t people with brown hair brownheads? Why brunettes?\u201d He lifted his wineglass. \u201cA question for the ages.\u201d \u201cPeople with blond hair are blonds, with an e on the end if female for some stupid reason. You got black hair, they say black-haired. Who decided to make up a whole new word for brown hair?\u201d \u201cI believe it\u2019s French.\u201d \u201cShould\u2019ve figured.\u201d She shrugged it off. \u201cAnyway. I don\u2019t get the lap dance thing. Paying somebody to sit on your lap and rub crotches. You can\u2019t put hands on her\u2014gotta pay more in a privacy room there if the club has a license for it. You just sit there with your pants on while she grinds and rocks on you. So if you get off, you get off in your pants, and that\u2019s gotta be a damn mess.\u201d Roarke took another slice of pizza. \u201cWho else has such fascinating discussions over wine and pizza? I\u2019ll say I\u2019m in general agreement re the worth of the lap dance, but to each their own.\u201d \u201cWhatever.\u201d She shrugged again, ate. \u201cLopez? She was born with those tits. Too much movement for otherwise.\u201d Roarke eyed her over the slice. \u201cInteresting comment. If I agree I might be accused of paying too much attention to those tits.\u201d \u201cAce, if you weren\u2019t paying attention to that set, you\u2019re not the man I married.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very much the man you married.\u201d Laughing, she took a bite of pizza. Traffic\u2014street and pedestrian\u2014had calmed, at least some, by the time Roarke drove uptown. Eve used the time to update Peabody. Lopez goes on the list. Full report to follow, but she\u2019s angry, a hard-ass, and had plenty of time on Monday to collect the case, swipes, etc. My sense is she had stronger feelings for the victim than she admits, and more dislike for Hunnicut than she let show. New angle: Dead artist = steeper prices for paintings. Who gets the paintings in the gallery, in the studio, elsewhere? Who already owns her paintings? Who among those might have money issues we haven\u2019t uncovered? No will, so next of kin? But there are several pieces we saw in the shared apartment. So possession to Shauna there. Gallery might have some sort of contract. Need to find out. Contact Frost, find out what you can on that. If we need more, we bring her in tomorrow. Delay that. We\u2019ll go to the gallery tomorrow. Meanwhile, double verify her travel, in case. I\u2019m going to want a list of who bought or was gifted any of her work. Let\u2019s play the angle out. \u201cIt could go toward revenge, too,\u201d Eve said when she finished the text. \u201cShe tossed me aside, or she\u2019s the reason Shauna tossed her aside, I not only get rid of that bitch, I cash in on it. What does a struggling young artist give pals for birthdays, Christmas, all the damn gift-required shit we worship in our society?\u201d \u201cA drawing, a painting, and likely something that has some meaning to the recipient.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I say. The amount of profit probably doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much as the satisfaction.\u201d \u201cAnd how do those just outside the tribe acquire them?\u201d \u201cMaybe they buy. In Stillwater\u2019s case, he got to be friends with the victim, too\u2014and he said he bought a couple. He stayed connected. Same with Barney, and he\u2019s added the Becca link to it. Rierdon? I\u2019ll find out.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt,\u201d he agreed, and drove through the gates. She looked at the house that Roarke built as the quieting summer sun dropped in the west. Her home, she thought, inside the city that was her home. Then she looked at him, the man who\u2019d made home more than she\u2019d ever known it could be. \u201cThat was damn productive pizza.\u201d \n Chapter Ten Eve expected Summerset to have retired to his rooms for the evening, but he loomed. She started to make a crack about vampires rising at sunset, but the cat padded over. Then stopped an inch from her boots. Galahad hissed, arched his back, then on a throaty growl, sent Eve a hard, feline stare out of his bicolored eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem? The rat dog? Are you kidding me? Jesus, I never even touched that little rat dog.\u201d In response, Galahad turned his back on her, stuck up his tail like an exclamation point, then stalked back to Summerset. \u201cI can\u2019t control every freaking dog in the city. Get over it, tubby.\u201d Because she felt guilty, and that made her feel ridiculous, she stalked up the stairs without another word. \u201cHe\u2019s a very proprietary cat,\u201d Summerset commented to Roarke. \u201cSo it seems. I expect they\u2019ll both get over it. Go, relax. Enjoy your evening.\u201d As Roarke started up, Summerset glanced down at the cat. \u201cNow, now, the children are home safe, and all\u2019s well. No little rat dog could hold a candle to you.\u201d Apparently mollified, Galahad trotted up the stairs. \u201cWhat an interesting family we make,\u201d Summerset murmured, and went back to his quarters to enjoy his evening. In her office, stewing, Eve began to set up her board. \u201cThe stripper\u2019s grandmother had one of those yappy dogs that looks like an overgrown rat.\u201d \u201cA Chihuahua?\u201d \u201cMaybe. Whatever. It sniffed at my boots. I mean, for Christ\u2019s sake, a boot-sniffing rat dog is the least of my problems out in the field. For all I know at this point, the woman with the boot-sniffing rat dog may have a murderer for a granddaughter. But he doesn\u2019t think of that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m quite sure he doesn\u2019t, possibly due to the fact he\u2019s a cat.\u201d Roarke watched the cat in question saunter in, ignore Eve, then take sprawling possession of her sleep chair. He decided it was wiser not to mention it. \u201cI\u2019ll just start on those financials.\u201d And, he thought, retire from this particular field. Eve finished the board, programmed coffee, sat at her desk to open her murder book. The cat wasn\u2019t the only one capable of ignoring, with attitude. Because she knew there was something there, she started a deeper run on ChiChi Lopez. Her great-grandparents had crossed the border into the States\u2014documentation vague on exactly when and where. But all four of their children had been born in the U.S. The younger two, including Anna Maria Lopez, n\u00e9e Delgato, had been born in New York. The restaurant had started as a food truck, then two food trucks. Anna Maria Delgato married Juan Lopez, and they had four kids while helping run the food trucks\u2014now numbering three. And their four kids had kids\u2014a hell of a lot of kids, Eve noted. Among them, ChiChi, age twenty-nine. Along the way, five years before ChiChi came along, they opened Abuela\u2019s. Six years later, they bought the building. Nothing she found indicated anything but a large, hardworking, savvy family. No doubt if she dug into each one, she\u2019d find some bumps, some issues, some problems, but unless she hit on something that applied to her investigation, she\u2019d stay out of that rabbit hole. She zeroed in on ChiChi. Private school education, dance lessons. She unearthed several articles giving her raves for school musicals. Which explained the major in theater, at least at the start of her college career. That switched to business major third year in. Two dings for assault, charges dropped. Anger management required. Worked as a server, then a line chef at the restaurant. And at twenty-one started as a dancer at the club. Worked her way up to headliner within a year. And it paid, Eve noted. It paid damn well. From what she could see, Lopez reported her tips. Probably not all of them, but enough to keep the tax man from knocking on her door. No cohabs, no marriages, no civil unions. Picking through the finances, Eve noted she continued to take dance classes, spent a hell of a lot on clothes\u2014most custom tailored\u2014more on salons and spas. She had weekly payments to a Dr. Rene Koons\u2014a shrink on the Lower West Side. Another weekly to a Stefan Michael, a masseur. And several payments over the last eight years to the gallery where Erin sold her work. She glanced up when Roarke walked in. \u201cLopez has two dings for assault\u2014mandatory anger management fulfilled. She sees a shrink every week. Might still have those anger issues. Started off as a theater major in college, switched to business major halfway through. Kind of a star in school musicals prior, so maybe she couldn\u2019t cut it in a bigger pool of talent. And maybe some of the anger issues come from there. She\u2019s spent a good chunk of change at the gallery where Erin has some of her work.\u201d \u201cShe invests well\u2014smart investments. It\u2019s easy enough to find\u2014through her insurance\u2014how much of that chunk of change went for Erin\u2019s art. I\u2019ll look at it. For now, I can tell you she invests well, has no hidden accounts, is very careful with her accounting. She\u2019s in excellent financial shape.\u201d Walking to her workstation, he programmed coffee for himself. \u201cAs are her siblings and parents. I can go back further if you like, but there\u2019s a pattern. Work hard, invest wisely, live within your means, but live well.\u201d \u201cThe money\u2014from the increase in art value\u2014that would be a bonus, not the main driver. Feelings, passions, anger, sex\u2014that would drive this. I keep coming back to that. What does a woman with a solid family, solid financials, living how she appears to want to live need weekly shrink sessions for? And why is she so pissed off?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t say, but I can see you have a thought on it.\u201d \u201cBecause at the end of the day, she\u2019s alone. She comes from a family where people end up married and popping out more family, and she\u2019s alone. She\u2019s got an older brother, age thirty-one, married two years ago, already has a kid. Younger sister got married last May. She has no cohab on record. She may have wanted Erin Albright to fill that spot.\u201d Pushing up, Eve paced. \u201cShe\u2019s got that nice house, nice neighborhood, and she lives alone in it. She clicks with Albright, the struggling artist. She could make life easier for her. Move in with me, don\u2019t worry about rent, concentrate on your art. Your art and me.\u201d Pausing, she studied the board. \u201cLopez\u2019s family knew Albright, so Lopez brought her around.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re thinking for approval.\u201d As usual, he followed her line of thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, more probable. I\u2019d bet she didn\u2019t bring all her bed partners around to meet her abuela. She didn\u2019t like Hunnicut, and most of that, it strikes me, comes from jealousy. They both wanted Erin Albright, but Shauna Hunnicut got her.\u201d \u201cYou sound half-convinced. Not all the way convinced.\u201d \u201cHalf\u2019s about right. If she did it, what did she do with the murder weapon, the jewelry she took off the body, the \u2019link?\u201d \u201cLittle time to dispose of it all.\u201d And that was the sticker, Eve admitted. \u201cLittle, but not no time. Maybe fifteen minutes. But nobody noticed her missing for that long. So it\u2019s a stretch.\u201d \u201cAn accomplice,\u201d Roarke suggested. \u201cA family member or lover\u2014or someone she promised sex to. Take the things to the back door, pass them off.\u201d \u201cNot impossible, so that makes it possible.\u201d But, Eve wondered, could the person Erin trusted trust someone else that much? \u201cYeah, possible. You could check the insurance, see how much she invested in the art. That could play in. She spent her hard-earned money to support the woman she wanted, and the woman didn\u2019t want her back. \u2018Let\u2019s just be friends\u2019 is the world\u2019s worst insult.\u201d \u201cAnd here I thought it was: \u2018It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u2019\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re the same thing.\u201d She turned to him. \u201cIf I ever dumped you, it would totally be you and not me.\u201d \u201cI appreciate that, darling, and the same goes.\u201d Amused, he pulled her in for a quick kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll go see about the art.\u201d \u201cGood. I\u2019m going to take another look at Shauna\u2019s exes. Stillwater\u2019s out of it. His alibi\u2019s concrete, plus they didn\u2019t have the feelings, the passion. That was affection and convenience.\u201d When she turned back to her command center, Galahad sat next to her comp. Looking, she realized, weirdly like the stuffed cat Roarke had once given her. Walking back, she sat, gave him as hard a stare as he did her. \u201cYou know, you never freak when I come home with blood on my boots, with boots smelling like death.\u201d He blinked his bicolored eyes once. \u201cBecause that\u2019s the job. Well, when I\u2019m investigating, I sometimes run into somebody\u2019s pet rat dog. And that\u2019s the job, too. Found you on the job, didn\u2019t I?\u201d She reached out, scratched him lightly between the ears. \u201cThe difference is, I brought you home.\u201d He nuzzled his head under her hand, purred. Feelings, she thought when he curled up on her command center as if to keep an eye on her. Passions, anger, jealousy. It fit here, and it fit in the murder of Erin Albright. She opened the file on Rierdon. As she read, as she dug, she checked the time. Not too late\u2014though Roarke would probably disagree. She contacted the mutual friend, Jodi, who\u2019d been at the party, who threw her own parties. To remain a suspect, Rierdon had to have known about the bride party\u2014the when and where. But the conversation with Jodi, and the three-way conversation with her and her cohab, ended inconclusively. Didn\u2019t recall mentioning it, but maybe. So maybe, Eve thought. It didn\u2019t explain the swipes, the case, and those remained major sticking points. No reason she could come up with for Erin to have trusted him, asked him to do the favor. More the opposite, she admitted. Back to high school, she decided, and took a deeper dive on Greg Barney. Nothing, she thought, just nothing popped. An ordinary guy, a regular guy. And sure, they killed, but nothing in his background, in his current living situation stood out. Financially \u2026 Roarke would make sure, but financially, he looked clean. Ordinary again. No gallery purchases she found. Maybe he\u2019d bought some of her sidewalk art, paid cash. Maybe he had some through gifts, or through Becca DiNuzio. Would they bother with insurance for that? Doubtful. Still, she rose to pace and play with the angle. Say they had a couple of pieces. And he could ask Shauna for another, in memory. Cash in when the value went up. It had to be more than that, she decided. But didn\u2019t she have more? Sweethearts, parted by college, then reunited. But one sweetheart is seeing someone else. Let\u2019s just be friends. So he turns to\u2014settles for?\u2014the other high school girl. That keeps him close to the tribe, close to Shauna. But wouldn\u2019t tribes have their own rules, and wouldn\u2019t not screwing around with the person a tribe member is screwing around with be at the top? How do you make a move on the old girlfriend when she\u2019s pals with your new girlfriend? Very sticky ground, she concluded. And how, she asked herself, would navigating that ground include murder? On the other side of the scale, the victim would have trusted him. One of Shauna\u2019s oldest friends, someone not invited to the party. He lived and worked close. And would she believe as one of Shauna\u2019s oldest friends, he\u2019d be happy with the surprise, happy to help pull it off? Add no alibi. Just an ordinary guy, hanging out at home waiting for his girlfriend to come back from a girl party. And see the flowers he picked up for her on his way home. A non-alibi alibi, Eve considered. He\u2019d been able to walk her through his steps\u2014closing the shop, walking to the bar, having drinks with a pal, and so on. She studied his photo on the board as Roarke came back in. \u201cHe was pretty specific,\u201d Eve muttered. \u201cI\u2019m going to think about that. You could do that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure I could. Do what exactly?\u201d \u201cWalk me through your day, times, people, meetings, meals. You keep a log in your head. Does he?\u201d \u201cWho would that be?\u201d \u201cGreg Barney, Shauna\u2019s high school guy, and her best friend\u2019s current cohab. He was pretty specific. Not like at nineteen-zero-two, I paused at the crosswalk. But close enough. But he didn\u2019t mention the flowers. DiNuzio reminded him about the flowers. An oversight, or a ploy? An oh yeah, right, I stopped for flowers. That way you\u2019re not absolutely specific.\u201d She started pacing again. \u201cLike you don\u2019t exactly remember the vid you were watching on-screen when you fell asleep on the sofa. Just some alien invasion thing. And that checks. Duplicates. Alien invasion deal available on the night in question. I bet if we checked that screen, that would\u2019ve been playing at the time he said.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re looking at him now because he was able to walk you through his evening?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one factor. They were the big-deal couple\u2014what did he say \u2026 Shaunbar. Some people never get over high school. Maybe he\u2019s one of them. Peabody was running through it today, mostly for the bullshit factor, but you know, it could play.\u201d She paced some more. \u201cBut the thing is, Shauna\u2019s just not the type who\u2019d jump back to him if he broke up with her best friend. That doesn\u2019t play for me. But would he know that? He should, but \u2026 Ego\u2019s blind.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s generally love.\u201d \u201cWorks with ego, too. She\u2019ll be grieving, so she\u2019ll be vulnerable. He\u2019s right there to pick up deli meat and make her a sandwich.\u201d \u201cIs that a new euphemism?\u201d \u201cNo, that\u2019s literal. He was hovering\u2014that\u2019s what Becca called it, and it\u2019s accurate. But shit, they all were in their way.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI have to let this cook awhile. What did you find out about Lopez and the art?\u201d \u201cThat she has a considerable collection. Again, a wise investment. In that collection are fourteen Erin Albrights, currently insured for fifty-eight thousand.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a lot by one artist, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt is, but you have friendship, and you have, very likely, a taste for a certain style of art.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot. I think it shows a focus on one artist, and one woman.\u201d \u201cThe last she purchased, again through the gallery, about two weeks ago, for a bit over five thousand.\u201d \u201cShe bought one of the paintings that paid for the Maui trip? Oh boy, that\u2019s just got to piss you off, doesn\u2019t it? You buy the painting, and she blows the money on somebody else\u2019s dream? You\u2019re partially paying for their honeymoon? And now she wants you not only to stand there and watch her big surprise, but help her with it? Fuck that.\u201d Eve smiled. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good one. That\u2019s very close to \u2018come into the box and let\u2019s chat\u2019 good.\u201d \u201cMeanwhile I took a good look at the victim\u2019s financials, and the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s. As clean as it gets, and I hate to say boring. They had a joint account, which they both contributed to, and split the household expenses. They each had their own account, for personal expenses. Clothes, gifts, I suppose, salons, and so on. They both lived carefully. \u201cThe victim opened a separate account three weeks ago.\u201d \u201cYeah, the honeymoon fund,\u201d Eve confirmed. \u201cMcNab found that.\u201d \u201cAnd she used that fund to buy the tickets, for the deposit to book the room. There\u2019s enough left to cover the rest of the lodging, plus all the food, entertainment, souvenirs, etc.\u201d He looked at the board, at the victim. \u201cIt was a lovely thing to do. To try to do.\u201d \u201cDid they insure the art in the apartment?\u201d \u201cThey carry the bare minimum renter\u2019s insurance.\u201d \u201cAll right. I need to think about all this. The victim would have trusted both Lopez and Barney. I can stretch a motive on either of them. Still need to talk to the gallery manager.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll think better on a decent night\u2019s sleep. You didn\u2019t get one last night.\u201d \u201cGive me another hour. I want to write this up, see if it makes any sense when I do. There was a meanness to this, Roarke, with the time and place. A meanness that says personal.\u201d She pointed to the board. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be someone already on there, and so far, Lopez and Barney are who\u2019s standing out. But I don\u2019t want to miss someone else because I\u2019m looking too hard at them.\u201d \u201cAn hour,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll play with more of the financials. It\u2019s not nearly as entertaining when it\u2019s all aboveboard.\u201d \u201cYeah, the job\u2019s just made of fun.\u201d \u201cMy part of it often is.\u201d He kissed her, then tapped the dent in her chin. \u201cAn hour.\u201d She used every minute of it, but had to admit fatigue, both physical and mental, set in by the end. So she didn\u2019t argue when Roarke, on the dot of the sixty-minute mark, stepped back in. She shut down, stood up. \u201cFind anything interesting?\u201d \u201cFinancials are rarely so boring,\u201d he told her, and taking her hand, led her from the room. \u201cIs Greg Barney still one of your top suspects?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe and Lopez are who I\u2019ve got at this point.\u201d \u201cWhich gives you two in under twenty-four hours,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cIn any case, financially, he\u2019s clean. Pays his taxes, his bills. Other than rent, his major outlay is clothing, with the bulk from the shop he manages, and dining. No investments, which is shortsighted of him, but he saves a bit. \u201cNo art purchases,\u201d he added as they walked into the bedroom where the cat already claimed the bed. \u201cNo art insured. As he cohabs with Becca DiNuzio, I looked there.\u201d \u201cShe was onstage dancing her half-naked ass off at TOD. But a cynical cop could theorize she and Barney were in on it together.\u201d \u201cI happen to know a cynical cop. Her financials, also clean and tidy, though she has some small investments\u2014an also clean-and-tidy portfolio.\u201d \u201cYounger brother\u2019s a Wall Street guy.\u201d \u201cWho advises her wisely. She does have a gallery purchase. One Erin Albright, valued at twenty-five hundred, purchased about six months ago, and has insured a second\u2014no purchase\u2014for twelve hundred. Insured since the first week in January.\u201d \u201cChristmas gift, I bet.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d agree.\u201d \u201cNot enough,\u201d Eve concluded. \u201cNot enough for the dead-artist angle.\u201d Stripped down to her underwear, she tried to think it through. Then just shook her head. \u201cEven the cynical cop has a hard time tying her into it. Why would she want Erin dead? I can\u2019t see it.\u201d \u201cConsider it time to turn it off, and see what comes to you in the morning.\u201d She knew he had that right, but her mind wanted to circle. She considered him, standing there all lean and gorgeous in his boxers. \u201cHard to turn it off. I need a distraction.\u201d She took three running steps and launched herself at him. Hooked her legs around his waist, her arms around his neck. \u201cAnd here you are.\u201d \u201cYour distraction, is it?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so good at it.\u201d She captured his mouth with hers until her humming system smothered the fatigue. \u201cSee? I\u2019m already distracted.\u201d \u201cI suppose I\u2019d best finish the job then.\u201d \u201cWell, obviously.\u201d All but nose-to-nose, she laughed as he carried her to the bed and dumped her on it. With a low growl, Galahad rolled away and jumped down. \u201cServes him right for getting pissy with me.\u201d Rearing up, she nipped at Roarke\u2019s chin. \u201cAll right, ace, you\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d \u201cAnd I do love my work.\u201d Now he took her mouth in a slow, deep, dreamy kiss that not only sent her system humming but clouded her too-busy brain. She sighed into it. As his hands ran down her sides, her skin tingled. \u201cSee, really good at it.\u201d Everything in her went soft, and all the sharp edges of the day smoothed into quiet pleasure. As the half-moon peeked through the sky window over the bed, she combed her fingers through his hair, the thick mass of it, and down the firm muscles of his back. She sighed again, lifting her arms as he drew her support tank up and over her head. His hands\u2014they had magic in them\u2014glided up her ribs, over her breasts, up to cup her face before gliding down again. A gentle passion, lulling her into a dream state. He loved seeing her like this, utterly relaxed, utterly open. All that fierce energy quelled into surrender, not just to him but to self. He could give, and she could take, then give back in return. It never ceased to enthrall him, this meeting of bodies, minds, hearts. No matter what troubled him, troubled her, no matter what horrors crept through the shadows of the world, they had this gift, this love, this passion. And the union it forged between them. He rolled, reversing positions, and she came with him, her body fluid as wine. Her mouth sought his, and clung there while he peeled the simple white briefs down her narrow hips. He rolled again, bodies tangling over the big bed, the smooth sheets. As warm skin edged toward hot, he closed his mouth over her breast, slid his hand between her legs. When she cried out in release, he felt the orgasm rocket through that long, strong body. Even as she shuddered with it, he drove himself into her so dark delight layered over dark delight. Not a distraction, an eruption with a change of tone both abrupt and glorious. She flew on it, stormed with it when he shoved her knees up to take more, give more. And desperate for the more, she matched his speed, his urgency until everything went bright and hot and beautiful. Until more was impossible. Until he said her name and emptied into her. She lay under the weight of him, dazed and drowsy. She felt his heart pounding against hers, or hers pounded against his. She couldn\u2019t quite tell the difference. The moon held a new place in the sky window, white and clear against the dark. Her lips curved when he pressed his to the side of her neck. \u201cI believe I did my job.\u201d \u201cDamn good job. Kudos. Where does that come from? Kudos? What language is that?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t make me have to distract you again.\u201d He shifted her, nestled her in. \u201cGive that mind of yours a rest.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have another distraction in you?\u201d \u201cWell now, if that\u2019s a challenge\u2014\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She managed a sleepy laugh. \u201cI\u2019m tapped out.\u201d But she laid a hand on his cheek. \u201cAnd the cat\u2019s back,\u201d she added when Galahad jumped on the bed again. As she began to drift off, it occurred to her they had a really big bed, and she ended up sleeping in it night after night, wedged between Roarke and the cat. And she liked it. \n Chapter Eleven It didn\u2019t surprise her to find herself within a dream. The dead woman preyed on her mind. Maybe being murdered in the same room where she herself had been targeted for death played into it. Maybe dying right before her wedding as she herself might have played into it. Whatever reason nudged at her subconscious, she stood in the Down and Dirty with the music pounding, the holo-band rocking. Onstage with them, Shauna Hunnicut and Nadine Furst, both half-naked, danced like lunatics. There was Peabody, with her bowl cut, giggling like a drunk teenager, and Angie Decker laughing with Mira. Mavis, with no baby belly, standing on a table. Crack at the bar, grinning as he mixed a drink for Lopez. All of this happened, she thought. Different times, but the same place, and now it blurred together into one wild and singular party. \u201cThey\u2019re having so much fun.\u201d Erin stood beside her wearing the pink heels, the grass skirt, coconut bra. \u201cCelebrating for us.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t really into it,\u201d Eve said. \u201cI was just coming around to understanding I wanted the whole marriage thing. It still scared the crap out of me, but I wanted it. I just didn\u2019t know why I wanted it.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared, and I wanted it more than I ever wanted anything. More than anything.\u201d Erin said it softly, like a sigh. \u201cBut we both loved, you and me. We loved somebody who loved us, and we both had friends who wanted to celebrate that. That\u2019s really mag.\u201d Erin looked down at herself, brushed a hand over the grass skirt. \u201cI never had a chance to put this on and make Shauna\u2019s dream come true. We never had a chance to put on our white dresses and make the promises you made.\u201d \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m no expert,\u201d Eve added, \u201cbut I think you\u2019d\u2019ve made a solid life together.\u201d \u201cWho says you\u2019re no expert?\u201d Erin did a little hula that made the grass skirt sway. \u201cYou know people. You get under the skin and know who they are.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the job.\u201d \u201cYeah. Your job, and you\u2019re trying to find out why I\u2019m dead, and who killed me. I wish I could tell you, but this is just a dream.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cYou got lucky.\u201d The statement held no bitterness, just flat truth. \u201cI sure as hell didn\u2019t. I\u2019m glad you did, since you\u2019re trying to find out why and who. But you got lucky. He wanted you dead, that dirty cop, and if he\u2019d gotten the full dose in you, if you\u2019d been drinking like he figured, you\u2019d be dead.\u201d \u201cI was getting married the next day. Maybe I didn\u2019t know completely why I was getting married the next day, but I wanted to stay sober.\u201d \u201cWe were supposed to have a few more days before the white dresses. I was a little bit drunk.\u201d They stood at the doorway of the privacy room now. For a moment Eve saw herself, fighting Casto off. He\u2019d gotten some of the drug into her, and he\u2019d blackened her eye, but she\u2019d taken him down. And the next day, a bright summer day, she\u2019d married Roarke under an arbor of flowers. She\u2019d carried petunias and made those promises to him. He\u2019d made those promises to her. They\u2019d kept them for three years and counting. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it, being married?\u201d She glanced over at Erin. \u201cMost of the time, yeah. It\u2019s nice. And when it\u2019s not, you know it\u2019ll get back there.\u201d \u201cYou trusted the bad cop, maybe not a hundred percent, but enough to be in there with him. But you knew how to fight. Me? I know how to paint, how to make art. I know how to tend bar and serve tables, how to clean an apartment. I don\u2019t know how to fight.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t have a chance to fight. And it wasn\u2019t personal with Casto. It was \u2026 business.\u201d She saw Erin on the floor now, in her party dress stained with blood that had flowed from the necklace of blood around her throat. \u201cYou never had a chance.\u201d \u201cI trusted the wrong person. So did Shauna. But I\u2019m dead, and she still trusts the wrong person, right? She doesn\u2019t know she trusts the person who killed me.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Eve said as the music and laughter banged her awake. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t.\u201d When she woke, the man she\u2019d married while she\u2019d sported a black eye\u2014mostly disguised with makeup\u2014sat on the sofa, tablet in hand, cat across his lap. The wall screen ran the stock report on mute as he sat in his sleek black suit with its gray pinstripes. She smelled coffee, and wished someone would just pour some in her before she had to move. The dream hadn\u2019t answered any questions, but it clarified, if it mattered, just how much the investigation brought back the incidents on the eve of her own wedding. And what it meant to her to wake like this, on so many mornings, and see him there, sitting across the room. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Roarke said without looking up, \u201cbut I can actually hear your brain waking up.\u201d \u201cIt can get noisy in there.\u201d \u201cAnd often does.\u201d He looked over now, and the easy smile faded. \u201cDid you dream?\u201d \u201cYeah. Not a nightmare, just a dream.\u201d \u201cThat troubles you.\u201d Rising, he went to the AutoChef, programmed coffee. When he brought it to her, she sat up. Instead of taking the coffee, she framed his face with her hands and kissed him. \u201cIt shows how smart I was and am to marry a man who\u2019d know how much I need coffee and get me some.\u201d \u201cAnd how smart I was and am to have lured you with real coffee in the first place.\u201d \u201cYeah, that was pretty smart.\u201d She took it now, drank. \u201cLike that first bite of New York pizza, my first taste of real coffee was a revelation.\u201d \u201cAnd the dream? A revelation?\u201d \u201cNot really. Maybe on a personal level a little. It blurred the murder party with the one at the D&D the night before we got married.\u201d And because he remembered, very well, the bruises on her face, he stroked her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly a wonder, considering.\u201d \u201cNo, and it\u2019s stuck with me through this. The whole girl pre-wedding thing, the D&D, the same goddamn room. I got lucky; she didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s never only luck with you, Eve. You have the training, the skills, the reflexes the victim couldn\u2019t have.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t trust Casto all the way. Enough to give him that shot at me, but not all the way. And\u2026\u201d She had to admit it. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way he was with Peabody. It bugged me the way he moved in on her. But she\u2019d been my aide like five minutes, so I didn\u2019t push on that.\u201d She shook her head, drank more coffee. \u201cAnyway, everybody\u2019s all mixed and mingling together. Nadine, Peabody, Mavis, Mira, and all that along with the other group. And I\u2019m standing there with the victim.\u201d She told him. \u201cThere\u2019s truth in there,\u201d he said. \u201cErin trusted the wrong person, and Shauna would trust the same one. Still trusts the same one.\u201d \u201cWhich makes me wonder, should I worry about her now? Will that trust\u2014or some detail or memory that cuts through it\u2014make her a target?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easier to kill a second time, and yet, wouldn\u2019t that risk focusing the investigation even more narrowly?\u201d Too early in the day to hit him with how he thought like a cop. Plus, he\u2019d brought her coffee. \u201cThere was a lot of luck in that first kill. Planning, yeah, and I think the intent to kill Erin had been in the works awhile. But the opportunity, that just opened right up. And the victim, trusting, opened the door for her killer by handing over that opportunity.\u201d \u201cRight now, Shauna\u2019s surrounded by friends, family as well, I expect. Getting her alone with enough cover to get away with it? Opportunities would be severely limited.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019ll worry.\u201d He tapped her head. \u201cBecause it\u2019s very noisy in there.\u201d \u201cSome. Thanks for the coffee.\u201d She got out of bed and into the shower. Surrounded by friends, Eve reminded herself. It would take more than luck for the killer, who was certainly among those friends, to get Shauna alone, kill her, and come up with cover. She\u2019d have to keep that worry in the back of her head, as she needed the rest to pinpoint the killer. After a spin in the drying tube, she grabbed a robe\u2014this one a pale lavender\u2014and stepped out. He had breakfast under domes, and the cat banished to the floor. Because he still worked on his tablet, she walked over, topped off his coffee, and poured herself another. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with that?\u201d \u201cSome of this, and some of that. Infrastructure improvement on your cop bar, Off Duty. We\u2019re so well under way that I imagine you can reopen by the holidays.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not opening anything. It\u2019ll have to open itself.\u201d \u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Because his response made her think he had ideas, and she didn\u2019t want to spoil her breakfast, she ignored that. \u201cAnd some work on guest rooms on the Great House Project. Both sides. Some communications with Peabody\u2019s parents, who\u2019ve let me know their housewarming gifts will be on the way by the end of the week.\u201d \u201cPartner\u2019s desk and blown-glass ceiling light. She\u2019s told me a half dozen times. More than.\u201d Eve lifted the domes. Waffles! Never the wrong choice. \u201cThey\u2019re coming, right? The Peabodys?\u201d \u201cThey are, but wanted the desk and light in place, as hopefully a surprise.\u201d \u201cNot big on surprises right now.\u201d She drowned her waffles in butter and syrup. \u201cBut I\u2019ll keep it zipped.\u201d \u201cThey also have gifts for Mavis and Leonardo. A charming little child\u2019s picnic table with benches, and a lovely family sculpture\u2014Mavis holding an infant, Leonardo holding Bella. A thank-you for opening their family to Peabody and McNab.\u201d \u201cNice. Seriously on target. We\u2019ve the gift thing covered, right?\u201d \u201cWe do, and they\u2019ll arrive well before move-in.\u201d \u201cOkay, good. The partner\u2019s desk deal. That would never work for us.\u201d \u201cI do on occasion use your auxiliary.\u201d \u201cOn occasion, and for short duration. How could you buy the next quadrant of the universe if I\u2019m sitting across from you digging for a murderer?\u201d \u201cAnd how could you dig for a murderer if I\u2019m sitting across from you negotiating the price of the next quadrant of the universe?\u201d \u201cExactly. But it\u2019ll work for Peabody and McNab. How do you negotiate buying a quadrant of the universe?\u201d \u201cSkillfully. But this morning I settled for closing the deal on a small resort in Australia.\u201d \u201cAustralia? What are you going to do with a resort in Australia?\u201d \u201cMake some improvements, which will include a five-star luxury spa and a few private villas. It\u2019s been let go a bit.\u201d \u201cSo you grabbed the opportunity.\u201d \u201cI did, yes. But I\u2019ll look into that quadrant for you first chance I have.\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d She polished off her waffles, rose to go to her closet. \u201cWhy are there kangaroos there? It\u2019s not like you see them hopping around the Bronx.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t often see elephants or lemurs there, either. I suppose things have their place.\u201d \u201cAnd crocodiles. They\u2019ve got crocodiles down there. Who decided it was a good idea to make something that swims around waiting to eat you? Sharks. There\u2019s another one. What do they do but swim around, eat fish\u2014or people when they get a chance\u2014and make more sharks? \u201cAnd people think New York\u2019s dangerous,\u201d she continued. \u201cThen they\u2019re off swimming in some lagoon, la-la-la, and chomp. Or it\u2019s how much fun it is to hike in the woods, and bang, a snake bites your ass. You decide to vacation in some cabin, because peaceful and pretty vistas. And it\u2019s all fine until some bear mauls you to death.\u201d Roarke listened with genuine fascination as she reeled off various deaths by nature. \u201cSailing along in your big-ass yacht, drink too much, fall overboard. And a shark bites off your leg. Take an African safari, and you\u2019re just asking to get eviscerated, dragged off into some jungle, and eaten. But people do it.\u201d She stepped out in tan trousers, a white tee, carrying a navy jacket. \u201cPeople do it,\u201d she repeated, and walked over to hook on her weapon harness. \u201cThen they come here, goggle at everything with their wallets all but hanging out, and when it\u2019s stolen, people back where they come from remind them, smugly, New York\u2019s a dangerous place. How they should\u2019ve gone to Australia to see the cute kangaroos.\u201d She loaded her pockets. \u201cAnd when they do, Marge is taking pictures of the cute kangaroos when one of the big bastards with the long claws hops up and slices Waldo open so his guts spill out on the ground.\u201d \u201cRemind me not to let you anywhere near the marketing for the resort.\u201d She sent Roarke a dark, knowing look. \u201cIt could happen\u2014the guts, not me and marketing. I\u2019ve got to go meet Peabody at the art gallery.\u201d Still fascinated, he rose. Then gripped her hips, kissed her. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to come across kangaroos or sharks and the rest, but see you take care of my cop nonetheless.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do that. Galahad\u2019s enjoying the syrup still on the plates.\u201d Roarke glanced back, saw the cat licking his whiskers. \u201cBloody hell. You distracted me.\u201d \u201cGuess I\u2019m good at it, too.\u201d She gave him another quick kiss. \u201cSee you later.\u201d She\u2019d distracted herself, she admitted as she jogged downstairs and out. With thoughts on predatory wildlife. She\u2019d rather face a gang of thugs hopped up on Zeus than a single kangaroo with six-inch claws. Or however long they were. She could probably take a kangaroo down with a solid stun, but for all she knew they traveled in packs or herds or whatever the hell. And she had to get her brain off kangaroos. She blamed Roarke and his Australian resort. She hit traffic, which she preferred over predatory wildlife. Since she had to deal with it, she used the extended drive time to think things through. They weren\u2019t dealing with a lunatic\u2014at least not someone overtly crazy. Not a serious calculator, either, because there had to be less risky ways to kill Erin Albright. So target specific. Motive? If Lopez, payback for rejection. If Barney, possibly still holding a flame for Shauna. If someone else \u2026 so far the dead artist = paydirt didn\u2019t hold up well enough to rate high. But maybe she\u2019d find out more from Glenda Frost. While it remained true a decent percentage of the partygoers could have slipped away just long enough to kill, the question of motive, and removing the weapon and the rest from the scene, remained. Motive first, she concluded, and the rest would come. Where was the gain? What was the reason? She added having a conversation with the other artist, Anton Carver, since Lopez had rolled around with him after Shauna came into the picture. Maybe his alibi wasn\u2019t airtight. Or maybe he knew something. At least a different viewpoint on Lopez. A separate conversation with Becca DiNuzio, she decided. Another viewpoint on Barney. She spotted Peabody at the entrance to the gallery with another woman. Pulling into a loading zone, she flipped on her On Duty light, waited for a break in the damn traffic. After nipping out of the car, she headed down the sidewalk. Glenda Frost, her blond hair in a braided roll at the nape of her neck, wore a sleek black sleeveless dress with black pumps that added about four inches to her height. Black-framed sunshades guarded her eyes as she unlocked the gallery doors. About five-three, she may have weighed in at a hundred pounds if you included the huge black bag hanging from her shoulder. Even without the out-of-town alibi, her physicality would have ranked her low on Eve\u2019s list. According to her data, Frost\u2014forty-six, divorced, one offspring\u2014had managed the art gallery for twelve years. Polished, attractive, she wore silver hoops on her ears and a wide silver cuff, intricately carved, on her right wrist. \u201cLieutenant Dallas,\u201d Peabody said, \u201cGlenda Frost.\u201d \u201cMs. Frost, thanks for meeting us.\u201d \u201cWhatever I can do to help.\u201d Her voice was as polished as the rest of her. \u201cErin wasn\u2019t just a talented young artist, she was a friend. Please come in.\u201d She led the way, switching on lights that showcased art. It hung on the white walls, stood on pedestals and glossy white or black tables. Some Eve understood, even liked. The portrait of a woman, her face a map of what was surely a century of life, the cobalt vase of bold orange flowers caught in a beam of sunlight. Others baffled her. Red and blue dots on a white canvas, a carefully detailed bag of soy chips. \u201cThe portrait there.\u201d Peabody gestured toward the old woman. \u201cThat\u2019s Erin\u2019s work, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes. Very good eye, Detective. She finished that about three months ago, from a photograph of her great-grandmother.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d \u201cSo do I.\u201d Glenda slipped off her sunshades, dropped them into her bag. She crossed the white floor to a black counter and stowed her bag behind it. \u201cShe recently sold three pieces,\u201d Eve said. \u201cYes, a triptych, moody still lifes, beautiful use of light and shadow. I saw them in progress, and told her I thought I had a buyer. My sister\u2019s an interior designer, and is working with a client I thought they\u2019d be perfect for.\u201d Glenda came back around the counter. \u201cI took photos of the works in progress, showed my sister, who agreed. But there was a deadline, and Erin worked so hard to finish them. It was her biggest single sale. We were so happy.\u201d \u201cShe also sold a single through you. About two weeks ago?\u201d \u201cYes, ChiChi bought one of Erin\u2019s we had on display. She\u2019s a collector. That\u2019s a smoke tree in full blossom. Erin painted it from one on the High Line, with a stormy sky behind, a flash of lightning in the clouds. Dramatic and detailed. We considered it an unexpected bonus so close to the wedding.\u201d \u201cDid she tell you what she intended to do with the money from those sales?\u201d \u201cNo. When I saw Shauna yesterday, she did.\u201d Pressing her lips together, Glenda looked back at the portrait. \u201cIt was so Erin, all of it. The trip, the surprise, the way she\u2019d intended to announce it. Do you see the life in this portrait?\u201d Walking closer, Glenda gestured up at the old woman. \u201cThe light in the eyes, the humor in the curve of the mouth? I can see Erin in there, in her great-grandmother. That should\u2019ve been her in another seven decades. Someone stole those years, that light, that life from her.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t make the party Monday night.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Turning back, she faced Eve. \u201cI\u2019d arranged my travel and my schedule so I\u2019d make the shower, and the wedding. I was coming back on Thursday\u2014tomorrow\u2014but\u2026\u201d She let that trail off. \u201cThe last time I saw her was in her studio. I helped her box the paintings, the ones for my sister\u2019s client, for transport.\u201d \u201cWas anyone else there?\u201d \u201cAnton. He often works at night. He actually helped us carry the paintings down. It surprised me he interrupted his work to help, but, well, Erin\u2019s happiness could be infectious. And she was so damn happy.\u201d \u201cAny artist envy with the others who share the studio?\u201d \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be uncommon.\u201d Idly, Glenda patted at the roll at the back of her neck. \u201cTemperaments, egos. I\u2019ve worked with artists for nearly twenty years. Some\u2014many, in fact\u2014can be challenging. But I didn\u2019t notice anything like that there. \u201cRoy\u2014that\u2019s Roy Lutz\u2014is focusing on his mural work, and that\u2019s a wise choice for him. My sister\u2019s commissioned him several times. Anton? He does mostly commercial art. Large pieces for offices and commercial spaces. He\u2019s quite good at what he does. He and Roy, opposites in style and personality. Roy\u2019s got a sweet nature, and Anton\u2014you\u2019d have to say a sour one. Donna? She and Erin were very close, and absolutely supportive of each other, in every way.\u201d \u201cDo you have access to the studio?\u201d Eve asked her. \u201cA swipe?\u201d \u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t have any need for that. For the most part, I\u2019d arrange to go by, see the work. Unannounced drop-bys interrupt the work. On commissions, occasionally the artist needs a little nudge, but you don\u2019t want to interfere with the process.\u201d \u201cErin had a lot of her work stored at the studio. What happens to it now?\u201d \u201cThat depends on Shauna and Erin\u2019s family, as it does with what we have displayed here. If possible, I\u2019d like to offer to do a showing. For the art, for the business of art. And for Erin, for Shauna and Erin\u2019s family.\u201d \u201cRegarding the business of the art, you think you\u2019d be able to sell her work?\u201d Glenda glanced back at the portrait, smiled a little. \u201cI do. If I\u2019m able to select the pieces, with the right display and marketing, I think her work would sell very well. That\u2019s my job,\u201d she added, \u201cand also a tribute to a friend.\u201d \u201cAre you friends with all your artists?\u201d Eve wondered. \u201cAbsolutely not. But Erin was a friend. I met her when I browsed by the street art, something I often did and do. And I saw something in her work\u2014that was, God, about five years ago. I bought two of her pieces\u2014a cityscape at sunset, and one of a pub scene. Both underpriced, and I bargained her down from that just to see if I could. Then I gave her my card, told her to bring me what she thought were her two best pieces.\u201d Glenda laughed even as her eyes went damp. \u201cShe told me I\u2019d just bought them, but she had more. And that started our professional and personal relationship. I helped her. I like to think I helped her. Her work needed to ripen and mature, and she lacked business sense. I like to think I helped her.\u201d \u201cOn the business of art,\u201d Eve began, \u201cwhat\u2019s the price of the portrait up there?\u201d \u201cForty-seven hundred.\u201d \u201cAnd if you keep it on display, manage to have that showing?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d double it.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s the business of art.\u201d Outside, Eve started toward the car. \u201cDouble it,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big jump.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d say she knows how it works, what she can get. Friends or not, if she had a dead artist, she\u2019d try for the posthumous showing. Likely, as manager, she gets a cut for finding an artist who sells, and maybe for putting on a showing.\u201d Eve got in the car, tapped her fingers on the wheel. \u201cShe was out of town, but could, possibly, have worked with someone else to do the cash-in thing. But I don\u2019t see it. Unless she has a river of dead artists behind her, it doesn\u2019t follow.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make real good business sense, either,\u201d Peabody pointed out. \u201cFind an artist, bring them along, then kill them to sell at a high price. You\u2019d run out of artists sooner or later, or get a bad juju rep.\u201d \u201cBad juju.\u201d Eve rolled her eyes, then pulled away from the curb. \u201cAnd I hate to say you\u2019re not wrong about the juju. Check and see about posthumous showings and/or sales through the gallery. But it doesn\u2019t really follow. \u201cLet\u2019s talk to Anton Carver.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s got a tight alibi.\u201d \u201cYeah, maybe we can loosen it. Or maybe he knows something. He was there when they took the art out of the studio. Maybe Erin got just happy enough to tell him she was going to book the trip. They\u2019re not particular friends\u2014according to Donna\u2014so he\u2019s not going to go blabbing to Shauna. She\u2019s happy, excited, wants to tell somebody. And he\u2019s right there.\u201d \u201cAnd if she did say something\u2026\u201d \u201cMaybe she said something to someone else, or he did,\u201d Eve finished. \u201cOr maybe he or someone else who came in looked in the case she\u2019s stashed. It was all in there, the tickets, the costume, the note. \u201cCarver and Lopez had sex in the studio, at least once.\u201d \u201cYeah, I saw that in your report. So maybe more than once. Maybe when the case was in there.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s pissed, and now more pissed. \u2018You don\u2019t want me, you\u2019re not going to have anyone.\u2019 Erin asks her to bring the case, and she takes that opportunity. Or Erin gets the case there another way, and Lopez, knowing what\u2019s coming, follows her to the room. Erin tells her, and she\u2019s \u2018Let me help you change.\u2019 She goes in first, or tells Erin to check the door, make sure it\u2019s secured. Kills her, tries to make it look like a robbery, leaves the door unsecured.\u201d \u201cThe only person who knows who Erin told is Erin, and she\u2019s dead.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how it stands. A tight group like that, your tribe deal. You\u2019d think something like this big surprise would make the rounds.\u201d \u201cYou knew Jenkinson was going for the DS exam, and we\u2019re a pretty tight group in the squad. You didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d \u201cJenkinson told Reineke. Yeah, his partner,\u201d Eve added, and settled on the crappy lot to park. \u201cAnd Reineke kept it in the vault. That\u2019s respect. But this is a surprise thing, not professional. People like being in the know, but so far, nobody\u2019s saying they knew.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got Donna.\u201d Peabody got out of the car to walk. \u201cShe knew about the case, but not what it was for. I believed her on that.\u201d \u201cSo did I. But Erin told her she had a backup, and that tells me she pulled somebody in when Donna went to Baltimore\u2014so the day before the party. Or maybe knowing Donna might have to book it to Baltimore, she set up a backup in advance. A just in case.\u201d \u201cIt was an important deal for her,\u201d Peabody commented. \u201cI can see a just in case.\u201d \u201cDecker strikes me as the most logical, but she\u2019d already put in time and trouble.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2014Erin\u2014don\u2019t want to pile on. Lopez makes sense. In your report, it has Monday as her day off, so Erin would figure, hey, she\u2019s clear.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, why not ask someone outside the tribe, somebody who hasn\u2019t had dick to do with showers, wedding prep, drunk girl parties?\u201d \u201cAnd that points, possibly, to Greg Barney.\u201d \u201cShauna\u2019s best friend\u2019s cohab. Also logical. Lives and works easy walking to the D&D. Actually closer than Lopez. A longer hike to the studio for the case, but not a lot. Or she gets him the case and he stashes it.\u201d \u201cMotive being he still has a thing for Shaunbar.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s personal. Whoever killed her,\u201d Eve insisted, \u201cit was personal. Sex, love, passion. Personal.\u201d At the street door, Eve started to press the button for A. CARVER, then decided to master in. \u201cSecond floor. Yay.\u201d They trooped up the stairs. \u201cEven outside the tribe, they\u2019re an incestuous group. Shauna\u2019s high school guy hooked with her best friend\u2014also from the same school. Lopez having sex with Erin, then with Carver. Barney having drinks with one of the other member\u2019s cohabs. The gallery manager\u2019s sister buying Erin\u2019s art for a client, commissioning the other artist\u2014Lutz\u2014to paint murals.\u201d \u201cFrost doesn\u2019t have that river of dead artists behind her, but she did have a couple of shows at the gallery for Anton Carver, four years ago, another two years ago. And Lutz\u2019s girlfriend sculpts. Frost carries some of her work.\u201d \u201cIncestuous,\u201d Eve repeated, and buzzed at the apartment door on the second floor. It took a second buzz before Eve heard a very irritated male voice from behind the door. \u201cThe fuck you want?\u201d \u201cTo speak with you, Mr. Carver. Lieutenant Dallas, Detective Peabody, NYPSD.\u201d \u201cYou want to talk to me, come back when I\u2019ve had more than three hours\u2019 sleep.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re here now. How about you open the door?\u201d \u201cUnless you\u2019ve got a warrant, I\u2019m going back to bed. Knock off the buzzing.\u201d \u201cWould you like us to get one? Then have this conversation down at Central? Or would you like to open the door and get it over with quickly?\u201d \u201cFuck\u2019s sake. Cops are a pain in the ass.\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s why we make the crappy bucks. A woman\u2019s dead, Mr. Carver, a woman you knew, one you shared studio space with for more than three years. If you don\u2019t open the door, being a pain-in-the-ass cop, I\u2019m going to start wondering why.\u201d Chains rattled, bolts slid, locks thumped. \n Chapter Twelve The man had shoulders as wide as Park Avenue, and stood at about six-five, a tattooed cobra coiled, ready to strike, on his bare chest. Black sleep pants drooped at his hips. The shoulders, bare chest, and all the rest were damn impressive. He had brown hair falling in wild and disordered curls to those impressive shoulders. Big hands with a smear of bright yellow paint running down the side of his right index finger. Hard, angry green eyes snarled out of a striking face that carried a couple days\u2019 worth of stubble. He smelled like a man who needed a shower. \u201cI already talked to this one right here.\u201d He pointed the paint-smeared finger at Peabody. \u201cI got dozens of people who\u2019ll tell you I wasn\u2019t anywhere near that damn sex club when somebody killed Erin.\u201d \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have any problem having a quick conversation. Want to have it out here?\u201d Carver gave a fulminating look at the door across the hall. \u201cBiddy over there\u2019s probably got her eye to the Judas hole right now. That\u2019s right, you old bat!\u201d He stepped back, jerked a thumb. \u201cMake it quick. I need my frigging beauty sleep.\u201d He slammed the door behind them. The apartment looked as though he\u2019d had a weeklong party. Glasses, dishes, take-out bags, a pizza box, clothes all crowded tables, chairs, a lump of a sofa. And art crowded the walls. Framed, unframed, some as big as the artist, others barely wider than his hand, hung everywhere in a riot of color and shape and texture. Among them, Eve spotted one of Lopez. She sat on a backward chair wearing only a black top hat and sky-high red heels. \u201cYou want to sit, find a spot on the floor. I\u2019m not moving anything.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell us the last time you saw or spoke with Erin Albright.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t say. Don\u2019t pay attention.\u201d \u201cYou helped her and Glenda Frost carry down some paintings.\u201d \u201cYeah, yeah. Big sale for her. She goes all giddy. Decent work.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cPretty good work. She put in extra time on it, so we were in the studio some nights. She kept her mouth shut. I didn\u2019t have a problem with her.\u201d \u201cDid anyone come to see her\u2014or you when you worked those nights?\u201d \u201cNobody came in. Nobody comes in when I\u2019m working unless I ask them to.\u201d \u201cDid anyone contact her?\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t say. Can\u2019t,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWhen I\u2019m working, I\u2019m working. The rest of them, they\u2019ll stop, take tags, make them. I don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t pay attention unless they get loud with it. Then I tell them to knock it the hell off.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cRoy, he doesn\u2019t use the studio more than a few times a week, and he works days when he does. It\u2019s down to Donna and me now, so we\u2019ll need to get somebody else in there to make rent. Fucking landlord gouges you, but it\u2019s a good space.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t seem very broken up about your colleague\u2019s murder.\u201d \u201cColleague\u2019s stretching it. We shared space. She was okay. I don\u2019t like people. They\u2019re not worth the time, the effort. But she was okay. Did decent work, kept to her area. Bubbled. I hate when people bubble, but she stayed in her space.\u201d \u201cShe brought in a case.\u201d \u201cA case of what?\u201d \u201cA black overnight case.\u201d \u201cWhat she kept in her area\u2019s no business of mine.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say it was in her area.\u201d He gave her an exasperated look. \u201cIf she brought something in, where else was she going to put it?\u201d \u201cWhat did you talk about after you helped take the paintings down?\u201d He dug a hand through his mass of curls. \u201cJesus. I don\u2019t know. It was a major sale, okay? I said like congratulations or something. She came back up to clean her brushes, and she said thanks or whatever, and how she had big plans for the money.\u201d \u201cWhat plans?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t ask. Why would I care? Her money, her business.\u201d \u201cHow often did ChiChi Lopez come in to see her?\u201d His gaze drifted to the painting. \u201cOff and on, that I know of. Erin worked evenings mostly, until about a year ago. Worked the sidewalk most days. ChiChi came in now and then when I was in the studio. They had a thing going.\u201d He slid his hands into the pockets of his sleep pants. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like people to see what\u2019s going on with them. I don\u2019t do portraits often, because people, but an artist has to observe, has to see.\u201d \u201cYou did ChiChi\u2019s portrait.\u201d \u201cYeah. She\u2019s got a body on her, and a damn good face.\u201d \u201cYou had a thing with her.\u201d \u201cWay short of a thing, and after she wasn\u2019t having one with Erin. You go bouncing on someone your studio mate\u2019s bouncing on, it\u2019s trouble. It\u2019s a bunch of talking and shit. Who needs that?\u201d \u201cWhen did you do the portrait?\u201d \u201cAfter I bounced on her a time or two.\u201d \u201cA time or two?\u201d \u201cThree or four\u2014who counts?\u201d \u201cHow did she feel about Erin and Shauna?\u201d \u201cHow the fuck would I\u2014\u201d He broke off, frowned. \u201cShauna\u2019s the redhead, right? The one Erin was going to make it legal with?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d \u201cGreat hair. Catches the eye.\u201d \u201cHow did ChiChi feel about them, together, about to make it legal?\u201d \u201cWhat do I care?\u201d \u201cShe never talked about it to you?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. Shit.\u201d He shoved at his hair again. \u201cSo she didn\u2019t like the redhead, figured she\u2019d just screw with Erin, then dump her ass. Wanted to know how often the redhead came into the studio. I couldn\u2019t say, so I bounced on her to shut her up. Who needs the drama?\u201d Then he frowned. \u201cYou think ChiChi killed Erin?\u201d \u201cRoutine questions, Mr. Carver.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s got a mean streak in her. You can see it in her eyes, even the way she moves. Get her pissed enough, yeah, she could do it. But if she wanted the thing back with Erin, it makes more sense to do it to the redhead.\u201d Then he shook his head. \u201cShit. Now I\u2019m awake all the damn way. I might as well go to the studio. Nobody\u2019s going to be there. Is that it?\u201d \u201cOne more.\u201d Eve pulled out her \u2019link, brought up Greg Barney\u2019s photo. \u201cDid he ever come to the studio?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t say. Not when I was working. Everybody\u2019s all-American. Good bone structure. Looks boring. Look, I\u2019m sorry about Erin, right? She was okay. But none of this has anything to do with me.\u201d \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t. Thanks for the time.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t come looking for more of it.\u201d He opened the door. \u201cBut if you see the redhead, you can tell her I wouldn\u2019t mind painting her\u2014from the back. The hair catches the eye.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d As they started down the steps, Peabody blew out a breath. \u201cChallenging fits. He doesn\u2019t give a baby rat\u2019s ass about anybody.\u201d \u201cRun his alibi again. He\u2019s big, strong. Big and strong enough to have done it. I don\u2019t see him caring enough to kill anybody, but run it again.\u201d \u201cHe liked her a little bit. As much as he seems capable.\u201d \u201cYeah, a little bit. And he liked bouncing on Lopez. And Lopez bounced on him to try to get what she could out of him on Shauna. He\u2019s probably smart enough to know that, but liked the bounce. Was any of Erin\u2019s work on his walls, since you have a good eye?\u201d \u201cMy good eye says it was all his. But yeah, he\u2019d know the business of art, he has access and could pick his way through the paintings she has in the studio. When he says her work\u2019s decent, that\u2019s high praise from him.\u201d \u201cAgreed. And if she told him she had plans for the money, maybe she\u2014what he said\u2014bubbled out the rest. Maybe she pissed him off about something. Maybe ChiChi talked him into helping her. It doesn\u2019t click nice and tight, but he\u2019s confirmed ChiChi didn\u2019t like the idea of Erin and Shauna together. She has a mean streak\u2014I saw that myself. So we\u2019ll push some.\u201d At the lot she got back in the car. \u201cAnd if he never saw Barney in the studio, it doesn\u2019t mean Barney wasn\u2019t there. During the day, or when Carver wasn\u2019t there. Harder to believe he never went in at least once or twice in the last year.\u201d She pulled out of the lot. \u201cWe\u2019ll head into Central. I want some thinking time.\u201d \u201cBefore thinking time, I need two minutes on the Great House Project. I\u2019ve held it in,\u201d Peabody continued before Eve could respond. \u201cI\u2019ve shown heroic restraint. Pin-a-medal-on-me restraint.\u201d Since Eve had expected that restraint to break long before now, and had mentally prepared herself for five minutes of house blathering, she shrugged. \u201cTwo minutes. Mark.\u201d \u201cOkay, all the bathrooms are done, and they\u2019re all absolutely ult. I\u2019m going to live in a space with three-and-a-half bathrooms. I can\u2019t believe it. Most of the lighting\u2019s in and just so mag. There\u2019s still some painting, then touch-up, and the built-ins in the craft room, and punch-out work, but Roarke says next month. We can live there. In September we\u2019ll be in. Mavis and Leonardo\u2019s isn\u2019t quite as far along, because it\u2019s a bigger space. But Roarke still says September.\u201d \u201cSecurity-wise, it wouldn\u2019t hurt for you and McNab to move in first.\u201d \u201cWe thought about that, but decided we want to move in all together. Because it\u2019s special, for all of us. We can start moving stuff in though. Like Mavis\u2019s studio is set, and it\u2019s wow, just wow. Same with Leonardo\u2019s workspace, Bella\u2019s playroom\u2019s done, and the nursery is really coming along. \u201cI packed up and took over all my winter clothes. I have a place to keep off-season clothes!\u201d Peabody indulged in a quick passenger seat dance. \u201cAnd we all have stuff, you know, decor and stuff, stored in the garage just waiting. Plus, a lot of my fabrics, yarn, anything I don\u2019t have a project going with.\u201d Peabody sighed as Eve pulled into the garage at Central. \u201cThanks for the two minutes. I just have one more thing.\u201d \u201cMake it fast.\u201d Eve got out of the car. \u201cIt already feels like home. We don\u2019t have furniture in or a lot of personal items and the pretty things, but it already feels like home. And still, whenever I walk in, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s real. That it\u2019s really happening. It\u2019s going to be our place. We\u2019ll live there and work there and sleep there and fight there, have sex there.\u201d \u201cPee in your three-and-a-half bathrooms.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d Throwing back her head, Peabody laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s everything I could want, so it doesn\u2019t seem really real. I\u2019m going to take such good care of it.\u201d \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, you already are.\u201d As the elevator door opened, Peabody\u2019s eyes filled. \u201cTime\u2019s up!\u201d Eve stepped in. \u201cAny blubbering, you take the stairs.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t blubber.\u201d With some visible effort, Peabody blinked the tears back. \u201cBut thanks for saying that.\u201d \u201cFact\u2019s fact. And murder\u2019s not only murder, but what we\u2019re paid to investigate. Add the fact\u2019s a fact that your paycheck\u2019s why you have boxes of stuff you bought to put all around the house currently stored in the garage.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s fact. And it\u2019s all perfect! Opening the boxes is going to be like Christmas squared.\u201d \u201cIf you want to keep drawing that paycheck, you\u2019re going to sit your ass in your desk chair and see if Carver\u2019s alibi is as solid as it looks.\u201d The doors opened; cops piled in. \u201cMetaphorically, my ass is already there,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cI really think the alibi\u2019s going to hold.\u201d \u201cCheck anyway.\u201d As the elevator continued up, Eve rocked back on her heels. \u201cHe\u2019s the type who\u2019d bash somebody\u2019s head in if they pissed him off. In the moment, passion of the moment. It\u2019s hard to see him planning out something that required all the time, thought, risk\u2014cold-blooded. But check anyway.\u201d The elevator stopped again, and more cops pushed on. Eve started to push out for the glides when Mira stepped in. \u201cHey, Dr. Mira.\u201d \u201cPeabody, good morning. And Eve.\u201d She looked morning fresh among the uniforms in her white sheath with a short, elbow-length grass-green jacket. The sky-high pumps matched the jacket. \u201cDo you have any time free for a quick consult?\u201d Eve asked. Mira time, she decided, might add more benefit than thinking time. Mira glanced at her wrist unit. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I have some right now. I\u2019ll ride up to your office with you. How\u2019s the house coming, Peabody?\u201d \u201cOh, I was just telling Dallas.\u201d And Peabody told Mira, in detail. Since she\u2019d asked Mira for the consult, Eve didn\u2019t feel she could escape to the glides. So suffered the elevator\u2019s stops and starts, Peabody\u2019s house bubbling, and Mira\u2019s enthusiasm for the bubbling until they reached her level. \u201cPush on the alibi,\u201d Eve ordered. She winced at Jenkinson\u2019s tie with a big, bug-eyed mouse the color of a tropical sea nibbling on cheese the color of spring daffodils. He called out, \u201cHey, Dr. Mira. Got a second, boss?\u201d She risked her retinas and stepped to his desk. \u201cWe want to follow up on a lead, on the cold one. It\u2019s warming up, but we need to talk to a possible source living in Boston. It\u2019s delicate, since she was married to the vic, and later married and divorced his best friend. Since the best friend\u2019s our prime suspect, we want to do it in person.\u201d Eve considered the time, the budget. \u201cHow warm?\u201d \u201cGetting pretty warm. I talked to Feeney\u2014not his case, but he was LT back in the day\u2014and he thinks we\u2019re on track. Running it through? Guy gets his head bashed in with a fireplace poker. Staged like a break-in, but that was bogus, sloppy. Only other person in the house, the wife. And she claims she had a headache, took some meds and a sleeping pill like nine o\u2019clock. Found him dead downstairs in the morning. Before that, they\u2019re out to dinner and have a fight, she tells him she could kill him for that, and sails out. \u201cWe got her going into their place\u2014nice place, Upper East\u2014twenty-thirty. Then the security system goes off-line just after twenty-three hundred. Vic hadn\u2019t come home by that time. Left the restaurant about fifteen after she did, and we can\u2019t trace his whereabouts.\u201d \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it the wife?\u201d \u201cShe never broke, LT. Stuck with the story. And the ME said how she\u2019d\u2019ve needed a stool to have bashed him from the angle he was bashed, and maybe some Zeus to bash with that amount of force. Last thing, the security system went down by remote, outside. And she was in.\u201d \u201cThen why are you going to Boston? And why the best friend?\u201d \u201cThree years later, she ends up married to the first husband\u2019s best friend. No evidence they did the hanky previous to the murder. They divorced like nine years ago, and she moved to Boston\u2014and he got a pretty sweet settlement.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re thinking the vic goes bitching to his best friend after the fight, the best friend decides to kill his ass, jams the security?\u201d \u201cThe best friend installed the system, so he\u2019d have a leg up there. Vic and best pal go to college together, roomies, he\u2019s best man at the vic\u2019s wedding when the vic marries money. And a looker with money. Vic was pretty liquored up at TOD, so say best pal\u2019s \u2018Hey, I\u2019ll get you home,\u2019 does the deed, stages the break-in, then he\u2019s there to comfort the widow\u2014who about a year after she got to be a widow, lent him money to start his own security business. He lived pretty high on her money. Still is.\u201d Jenkinson lifted his hands. \u201cNothing to hang on him back when, Dallas, but you look at the pattern since, and it starts to smell. She was married to the guy for six years before she booted him. She may know something she doesn\u2019t know she knows. But it\u2019s delicate.\u201d Since she trusted Jenkinson\u2019s instincts as much as her own, she gave the nod. \u201cGo to Boston.\u201d \u201cThanks.\u201d Mira joined her in the walk to her office. \u201cBy my math, he\u2019s working a case that\u2019s eighteen years old.\u201d \u201cGuy got his head bashed in and nobody paid for it. That\u2019s first. Then? There\u2019s a different kind of satisfaction in taking someone down when they\u2019re sure they\u2019ve gotten away with it.\u201d \u201cAnd you think they will, take the best friend down?\u201d \u201cI think if Feeney says they\u2019re on the right track, he probably caught a whiff of what Jenkinson smells now when the case was fresh, but the investigator couldn\u2019t pin it. And what he just ran down for me? Yeah, it smells.\u201d Mira looked toward the board when they stepped into Eve\u2019s office. \u201cYours is fresh now.\u201d \u201cYeah, and I can\u2019t pin it. Take the desk chair. I\u2019ve got that tea stuff.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind some, along with your rundown.\u201d \u201cThe victim, Erin Albright, garroted with piano wire at her pre-wedding girl party. Inside a privacy room, one she\u2019d booked, at the Down and Dirty.\u201d \u201cAt Crack\u2019s. That\u2019s difficult for him.\u201d Mira crossed her legs, watched Eve with her quiet blue eyes. \u201cAnd you, as you were attacked there on the eve of your wedding.\u201d \u201cIn the same privacy room. Adds to that.\u201d Eve offered the tea, took coffee for herself. \u201cHer fianc\u00e9e, another female, was also in attendance.\u201d Eve gave the rundown. \u201cSomeone she trusted, yes, almost certainly,\u201d Mira concluded. \u201cShe\u2019s young, in love, excited, and wants to give the woman she loves this gift in that time and place. In the company of friends who, she\u2019d certainly believe, would share that joy in a dream fulfilled.\u201d \u201cSomebody didn\u2019t. Not a lot of time to plan if it came up when asked to deliver the case. I think wanting her dead preceded that.\u201d \u201cAnd the request opened the door,\u201d Mira finished. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication the victim felt threatened previously? Had a problematic relationship with anyone who had access?\u201d \u201cChiChi Lopez pops there.\u201d Eve tapped the photo on the board. \u201cSex, a few times, which by all appearances Lopez took more seriously than Albright, who cut off that aspect after she met Hunnicut. Lopez subsequently engaged in a sexual on-and-off relationship with Anton Carver, one of the victim\u2019s studio mates. This gives her easy access to the studio, and the case once it was there. She was at the party, could possibly have slipped away, murdered Albright, slipped back. Albright may have asked her to bring the case, which would give her access to the privacy room.\u201d Eyes on the board, Eve drank some coffee. \u201cShe\u2019s got a mean streak in there, and doesn\u2019t much like Hunnicut.\u201d \u201cPersonality or jealousy?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to say both. Plus, she got kicked out of bed, replaced. More, they\u2019re getting married, and she\u2019s supposed to act happy about that. The timing on it\u2019s tight but doable. \u201cCarver.\u201d Eve shook her head. \u201cAccess to the case, but he\u2019s so self-absorbed, why would he care? At the same time, he likes sex with Lopez, he strikes as almost permanently pissed off. His alibi seems solid, but Peabody\u2019s checking to make sure it holds. The vic had just sold three paintings\u2014a what\u2019s it? Triptych. And another to Lopez\u2014and though it\u2019s verified he seemed good with that, maybe he wasn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cSo back to jealousy.\u201d \u201cYeah. Jon Rierdon, one of Hunnicut\u2019s exes. She broke it off, before Albright, and he wasn\u2019t happy about it. No alibi, but no way he had access to the studio, or that she would have trusted him with the case and delivery. Physically strong enough to have done it, and mutual friends may have mentioned the party\u2014time and place\u2014to him. Motive\u2014back to jealousy and rejection\u2014but I don\u2019t see the opportunity.\u201d Now she tapped Greg Barney\u2019s ID shot. \u201cAnother ex, Hunnicut\u2019s, but going back to high school. All indications are they mutually parted at college time. Reconnected later, back in New York, but as friends. And he\u2019s cohabbing with Hunnicut\u2019s best friend. Also attended the same high school.\u201d \u201cYou see trust there.\u201d \u201cI do. Yeah, she\u2019d have trusted him. So opportunity\u2014as he doesn\u2019t have a solid alibi. Means, he\u2019s physically capable. Motive? Does he still have feelings there? Maybe using her best friend to keep the connection tight, keep his pride. Maybe he didn\u2019t realize he had those feelings until she\u2019s about to marry somebody else. \u201cHe wanted to make her a sandwich.\u201d \u201cA sandwich?\u201d \u201cMake her a sandwich, get her tea.\u201d After a shrug, Eve stuck her hands in her pockets. \u201cTaking care of her. But they all wanted to take care of her\u2014of Hunnicut. It\u2019s a tight group\u2014Peabody says like a tribe. Everybody loves everybody. That\u2019s where Lopez stands out for me, because she doesn\u2019t. But Barney was the only male there at the follow-up when they\u2019re all there to take care of her.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re looking at trust, misplaced in that tight group, and jealousy, a rejection of intimacy and sex.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve got. And where these two stand out. Lopez and Barney. Neither fit nice and snug. She doesn\u2019t bother to hide the resentment and a kind of disdain for Hunnicut. Previously, Hunnicut only dated men, so what the hell is this? Where did she come from, how does she rate? I\u2019m sexier, got a better body. And she dumps me for her, then asks me for favors? I\u2019m going to fuck it all up.\u201d Eve nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s got that in her. Screw with me, I screw back harder. That\u2019s in there.\u201d \u201cAnd Greg Barney?\u201d \u201cWe were important in high school. The big-deal couple. Shaunbar. Now I\u2019m hooked up with her best friend. It\u2019s not the same, it\u2019s not important. So I\u2019m not important. Wants to get that back, and all of a sudden, she\u2019s with another woman? What does that make me? The only way to get that back is to take out the obstacle.\u201d Frowning, she thought of Jenkinson\u2019s cold case. \u201cAnd be there to comfort the not-quite-a-widow.\u201d \u201cThere would be another obstacle there, wouldn\u2019t there? The best friend he\u2019s with. A tribe has codes.\u201d \u201cYeah, it would take some time, some maneuvering. But it\u2019s already taken time. Since high school.\u201d Eve tapped both ID shots. \u201cThese two stand out, but do they stand out because I don\u2019t have anyone else, or because one of them did it?\u201d \u201cKilling her at that place and time indicates a deep need to punish, ruin, a willingness to take the opportunity and risk in order to prevent the marriage. It may have been the gift\u2014the trip, the dream, that pushed the killer to take that risk.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not much time to plan, to work out the timing, make or access the weapon. But yeah, that fits. They would\u2019ve looked in the case, and the contents? A serious pisser.\u201d \u201cMisplaced trust, I agree. Someone harboring a resentment kept under control, concealed. And the gift, so very symbolic, ignited that resentment. It\u2019s personal,\u201d Mira added. \u201cA very personal killing. A marriage thwarted\u2014they will never take vows, never become wives. A honeymoon thwarted\u2014they will never have that dream, one that includes, as honeymoons do, an emphasis on sex and intimacy.\u201d Mira set her mug aside. \u201cThough planned, as you said, for the method, for the timing, it was a moment of passion. Cold and hot blood running at the same time. They\u2019re not entitled to this, this won\u2019t happen. I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d \u201cBecause she rejected me? Or because she\u2019s in my way?\u201d Mira smiled, rose. \u201cThat, I\u2019m afraid, is for you, but whoever did this is very good at wearing a mask, and perhaps believing they don\u2019t wear one at all. They did what needed doing, no more, no less. The wedding\u2014that insult\u2014will now be a memorial. Which they\u2019ll no doubt attend. They may even grieve a little, but with no guilt.\u201d \u201cMasks slip.\u201d \u201cThey do,\u201d Mira agreed. \u201cYou\u2019ll watch for that, and I believe you\u2019ll recognize what you see beneath it when it does. I have to go.\u201d \u201cThanks for the time.\u201d \u201cIf you want to talk any more of it through, just let me know.\u201d Trust and sex, Eve thought as Mira\u2019s heels clicked down the hall. She got more coffee, took her desk chair, and studied the board. Hot and cold blood running together to do what needed doing. That, she found, was an interesting thought. She heard Peabody coming, didn\u2019t bother to look around. \u201cHis alibi held.\u201d \u201cYeah, no way Carver could\u2019ve done it.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Not enough cold blood there. \u201cHe\u2019s not in it. Let\u2019s see if we can talk to the two best friends again\u2014DiNuzio for Hunnicut, Decker for Albright. But separately. Let\u2019s see if we can get them to come in\u2014separately.\u201d \u201cDivide and conquer?\u201d Eyes on the board, Eve nodded. \u201cSomething like that. Makes it easier to get them to dish some dirt. Give me twenty, then let me know. We\u2019ll go to them if necessary, but I\u2019d rather pull them in.\u201d \u201cLounge or box?\u201d \u201cBox. Let\u2019s keep it official, maybe a little intimidating.\u201d \u201cGot it.\u201d Eve rose to rearrange her board. Everybody wore a mask sometime, she thought. Even if for politeness, to spare hurt feelings. But put them in the box, push the right buttons, and that mask usually slipped. You never knew what you might see or hear when it did. Sitting again, she studied the new configuration of her board, one that put Lopez and Barney at the top, the victim in the center, and Shauna Hunnicut beside her. Both victims\u2014one with her life taken, one who would live her life with that loss inside her. From there, other friends radiated with their connections highlighted. A lot of crisscrosses, she noted. Yes, a lot of intersects. But some of those intersects had only started a year and change before, and others went deeper, longer. The deepest and longest to Hunnicut: Barney and DiNuzio\u2014as were their links to each other. Add Stillwater, but he was out of it, as was Rierdon. The deepest and longest to Albright: Frost, Fleschner, Decker, Lopez. Sitting back, boots up, she closed her eyes and let her mind circle. Take DiNuzio and Decker first and see what, if anything, came out of it. Another hit at Stillwater. Longtime booty buddy, and people said things in bed after sex they might not say otherwise. Then Fleschner\u2014devoted friend, absolute trust, first pick for helping with the surprise. Painting together, sharing that bond. What else might Albright have shared with her, or tossed off as an aside, an observation? A tight group, sure, but even tight groups had their issues. Push the right buttons, she thought, and maybe some of those issues spilled out. She heard Peabody coming back. She opened her eyes, but left her boots up. \u201cThat\u2019s your twenty, and DiNuzio\u2019s out running errands. She can come by in about thirty. Decker said she can come in when Shauna leaves to go with Erin\u2019s parents to make some arrangements. They\u2019ve decided to have the memorial right away, like tomorrow.\u201d \u201cQuick.\u201d \u201cYeah, they don\u2019t want it any closer to the wedding date. Decker needs a few hours.\u201d \u201cThat works.\u201d Eve lowered her boots, swiveled around. \u201cHere\u2019s how to play it.\u201d \n Chapter Thirteen When a case bogged down, backtrack and look for an area to shake something\u2014anything\u2014loose. To Eve\u2019s mind, that began with the victim\u2019s tribe, who stood as witnesses and the suspect pool. Becca DiNuzio and Angie Decker, the brides\u2019 best friends, topped that list. People knew things they didn\u2019t realize they knew, saw things they didn\u2019t register or remember without prompting. Or, in her cop experience, did things only they truly understood, and hid those acts under the guise of innocence. Becca DiNuzio spent her high school years outside the shiny circle of Shaunbar. Eve well understood standing outside that sort of circle as a teenager. While she hadn\u2019t wanted entr\u00e9e\u2014anything but, at that point in her life\u2014she also understood many craved it. Had there been envy, some resentment? Maybe some careless act or a few careless words that had rooted inside? Now the one outside stood inside. Best friend of one, cohab of the other. But how did it feel to have the man she lived with \u201chover\u201d\u2014her own word\u2014over his high school love? Had the close relationship of the two halves of Shaunbar stirred up that resentment? Now Shauna\u2019s about to marry, and you\u2019re not. She\u2019s about to see a dream come true\u2014and you\u2019re not. Again, in her cop experience, people killed for less. Opportunity? No. Other witness statements put Becca onstage at TOD. But connections crisscrossed. And there was Barney. Albright asks DiNuzio to deliver the case. DiNuzio conspires with Barney to kill Albright. In Interview A, Eve sat back. \u201cBullshit. Smells like bullshit.\u201d But she\u2019d leave it open as a possibility. More, she wanted Becca in the box to try to pry something\u2014again, anything\u2014she knew, had seen, sensed she didn\u2019t realize or understand. She wanted a better handle of the group dynamics, the pecking order, the allegiances. When the door opened, Eve closed the file, rose as Peabody escorted Becca in. \u201cThanks for coming in,\u201d Eve began. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I want to help, and I was out and about anyway.\u201d With her strawberry blond hair pulled back in a tail, her blue eyes shadowed, Becca looked around the room. \u201cIs this where you interrogate suspects?\u201d \u201cInterview. It\u2019s an interview room. Please, have a seat. We\u2019ll try not to keep you long. We\u2019re going to record this.\u201d \u201cIt helps keep the details straight,\u201d Peabody added. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I get you something to drink? I don\u2019t recommend the coffee.\u201d \u201cOh, um, can I get a Coke? I could use the boost. None of us have been getting a lot of sleep.\u201d \u201cSure. Pepsi, Lieutenant?\u201d \u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d Eve sat again as Peabody went out. \u201cRecord on. Dallas, Lieutenant Eve, in Interview with Becca DiNuzio in regards to the investigation of the murder of Erin Albright.\u201d \u201cIt sounds really official.\u201d \u201cIt is. We\u2019re focused on finding who killed Erin.\u201d With the intimidation factor firmly in place, she switched tactics. \u201cHow is Shauna doing?\u201d \u201cActually a little better, I think, because she\u2019s mad. The mad\u2019s getting her through right now. But I worry about tomorrow. We\u2019re having Erin\u2019s memorial tomorrow.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s quick.\u201d \u201cI know, but Erin\u2019s family, and Shauna, too, wanted it as soon as possible. Because the wedding was supposed to be this weekend, and that\u2019s \u2026 It\u2019s hard. Erin\u2019s mom actually knows someone who works for a memorial service company, so they were able to schedule it right away.\u201d Lifting her hands, she pressed her fingers to her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d \u201cI understand. Peabody, Detective Delia, entering Interview. Is Shauna still staying at Angie\u2019s?\u201d \u201cThanks.\u201d She took the tube from Peabody, cracked it. \u201cYes. In fact, she doesn\u2019t want to go back to the apartment at all. Ever. Doesn\u2019t want the furniture or most of their things. One of my errands was to talk to her landlord to explain she\u2019d sublet the apartment, and furnished, until the lease is up. She\u2019s going to find another place.\u201d Eyes full of worry, she turned the tube around and around in her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right thing, but it\u2019s what she wants. And she\u2019s doing all that, deciding all this, while she\u2019s so upset, while she\u2019s grieving. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re worried about her,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cThat\u2019s natural.\u201d \u201cI\u2014I went by their place and got their wedding dresses.\u201d Becca took a deep gulp from the tube. \u201cTook them to a consignment shop.\u201d \u201cThat was hard for you,\u201d Peabody murmured. \u201cOh God, it was awful. We helped them pick out those dresses. Me, Angie, Donna, Jodi. We made a party of it. But I think that was the right thing. I think that was right. How could she bear to look at them again?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s lucky to have a friend like you,\u201d Eve put in. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have each other. She\u2019d be there for me if anything happened to Greg. God, I can\u2019t even imagine it, but I know she\u2019d be there for me.\u201d \u201cLongtime friends. But no, not really,\u201d Eve corrected. \u201cYou weren\u2019t friends in high school. Not part of Shauna\u2019s\u2014or Greg\u2019s\u2014social circle.\u201d \u201cMe?\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cHard no on that. They were gold, and I was the awkward wheeze who aced every test while always wearing the wrong clothes.\u201d \u201cHigh school\u2019s tough. It\u2019s so easy to get wounded at that age, and carry the scars with you after.\u201d \u201cI think I was too oblivious to get any serious wounds.\u201d With the faintest smile, she sipped some Coke. \u201cA few scratches maybe. I had a couple friends\u2014fellow wheezes and/or nerds. One joined the navy right after graduation, and I haven\u2019t seen her since. The other moved to London for a job about four years ago. We keep in touch when we can.\u201d \u201cBut you weren\u2019t friends with Shauna or Greg?\u201d \u201cNo. I knew them\u2014everybody did\u2014and Shauna knew me, sort of, because we had a few classes together. We were lab partners on a chemistry assignment once. When we ran into each other again, I have to admit, I was surprised she remembered that, or me.\u201d Smiling, Becca sipped more Coke. \u201cStill a wheeze at the core, I guess, but I dress better now.\u201d \u201cAnd she and Greg? No rekindling of Shaunbar?\u201d \u201cNo. They\u2019d both moved on. Lucky for me.\u201d She fingered a gold chain with its pair of interlocking hearts around her neck. \u201cStill, I followed the code.\u201d \u201cThe code?\u201d \u201cYou know, about dating a friend\u2019s ex. Even though we\u2019re talking some years. When Greg asked me out, I mumbled something about checking my schedule and getting back to him, and tagged Shauna to make sure it was okay with her.\u201d \u201cI take it, it was.\u201d \u201cShe said she\u2019d hoped we\u2019d give it a try because she\u2019d seen a spark. She\u2019s my best friend for a reason, Lieutenant. She\u2019s loving, kind. She\u2019s no pushover, but I\u2019ve never known her to deliberately hurt anyone. Even back when she was high school royalty, she never punched down. \u201cI hate this happened. I can\u2019t understand how it could have.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re helping us find out how and why and who by being here,\u201d Peabody told her. \u201cShauna was all good with your relationship with Greg. What did you think when you met Erin?\u201d \u201cSurprised\u2014my first reaction\u2014because this time I saw a spark where I absolutely didn\u2019t expect to. I said something to Shauna like did she know Erin had a crush on her, and it looked like she was crushing back. She started to brush it off, you know, then she blushed. The redhead\u2019s curse,\u201d she said, tapping her own hair. \u201cShe said, \u2018Well, maybe.\u2019 They just worked, fit together, made each other happy.\u201d \u201cHow did your other mutual friends react, to Erin, to the relationship?\u201d Eve asked. \u201cI guess there was some surprise, like my initial reaction. And I guess some figured it was just a phase, but that figuring didn\u2019t last long because it so clearly wasn\u2019t. Greg was a little weirded out.\u201d \u201cWeirded out,\u201d Eve prompted. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s like WTF baffled. But he\u2019s a guy, and a guy she\u2019d been with\u2014her first been with\u2014and reacted like a guy. I ran into Marcus\u2014\u201d \u201cMarcus Stillwater?\u201d \u201cYeah. We just ran into each other on the street, grabbed a drink, and he was a little bit baffled, too. Guys.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHad she and Marcus ever been serious?\u201d \u201cNo, not on either side. Buds. Buds with bennies, but nothing more than that. And it didn\u2019t take long for him to make buds\u2014no bennies, but good buds\u2014with Erin. He tossed them a little engagement party at Tippler\u2019s. That\u2019s a bar some of us go to.\u201d \u201cIt sounds like Shauna\u2019s circle absorbed Erin into it,\u201d Peabody commented. \u201cYeah, you could say that. First, I guess, because Shauna loved her, but just as important because everyone just liked her. She was fun, talented, always up, you know? And it was so crystal how much she loved Shauna, how much she wanted to make Shauna happy, make a good life with her.\u201d \u201cYou and Angie Decker seem like good friends,\u201d Eve said. \u201cDid Erin\u2019s circle do the same, absorb Shauna?\u201d \u201cI think so. I mean Angie, Donna, and Erin went back. I felt comfortable with them right out. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve gotten to be solid friends with helping plan the wedding, doing the shower, all of that. From what I know now, I\u2019d say Angie and Donna, especially, had some worries Erin would get her heart broken. You know like some of Shauna\u2019s friends thinking Shauna was going through a phase. But it didn\u2019t last. \u201cAnd since you\u2019re talking circles, it\u2019s like the circle widened, or the circles interlinked. For me, the high school wheeze, having so many women friends is a personal miracle. And we sure as hell need each other right now.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a diverse, interesting group,\u201d Eve commented, and opened the file as if referring to it. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to all of you now. Artists, managers, execs, businesswomen, professional mothers, medicals, chefs, a stripper with a family who owns restaurants and real estate.\u201d She glanced up. \u201cChiChi Lopez and Erin were involved at one time.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the word for it. Maybe buds with bennies again, at least on Erin\u2019s part. And like with Marcus and Shauna, the bennies stopped.\u201d \u201cAnd did ChiChi accept that as easily as Marcus did?\u201d Becca shifted, and hesitated for the first time. \u201cI guess so. I don\u2019t know her as well as I do Marcus.\u201d Eve offered an easy smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not as friendly.\u201d \u201cNot really. I mean, we get along fine. A bunch of us went to see her perform, and wow, that was an eye-opener.\u201d She popped her eyes wide to demonstrate. \u201cI don\u2019t mean just the naked part, but she\u2019s got some moves.\u201d Eve waited a beat. \u201cBut?\u201d \u201cOkay, well, she\u2019s a little bit mean. Got a bite to her, and I try to avoid getting bitten, so we\u2019re not as friendly.\u201d \u201cDid she ever bite Shauna?\u201d Peabody wondered. \u201cA few nips. Shauna let it go. I mean, she told me, and Shauna can bite back when she needs to. To tell the truth, I think ChiChi was a little jealous, and doesn\u2019t like Shauna very much. Or me, either.\u201d She shrugged at that. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t know if she likes anybody much except Erin. Like Donna told me ChiChi said to her if she was going to transition, she should\u2019ve paid for better boobs. That\u2019s just mean and\u2014and ignorant. Donna said she said it like a joke, but it stung.\u201d \u201cBut Erin trusted her.\u201d \u201cSure. I don\u2019t think they were as tight as they were before, but I can\u2019t say for sure, since I didn\u2019t know them when they were, you know, buds with bennies. But friends were important to Erin\u2014that\u2019s something else she and Shauna had in common. They kept their friends, they valued their friends.\u201d \u201cBecca, it\u2019s probable someone they considered a friend did this.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe that. I guess I don\u2019t want to.\u201d \u201cWhen you were onstage with Shauna, when it was close to midnight and you were up there, did you notice anyone who wasn\u2019t in the club? See anyone slip out, like to use the bathroom?\u201d \u201cI think about it and think about it. Every time I close my eyes I go right back there. I\u2019d had a lot to drink, and believe me, I\u2019d never pictured myself dancing half-naked in a sex club. It\u2019s just a blur.\u201d \u201cDid ChiChi get onstage?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Becca rolled her eyes. \u201cA few people said she should. You know, like \u2018Show us how it\u2019s done!\u2019 But she just said how she got paid for that. I don\u2019t know if she even danced much on the floor. Dressed and everything, but I didn\u2019t really pay attention or hang out with her.\u201d \u201cWho did? Hang out with her?\u201d \u201cErin, I guess. Angie some. Oh wait, she did dance some. With that guy\u2014the one who came in. Tall, blond, built. Sexy dance, but that was earlier. I didn\u2019t see Erin leave. I just didn\u2019t see.\u201d She glanced at her wrist unit. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but I need to go. I still have some things to get done.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate you coming in, talking to us.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how it helps, but I hope it does. I don\u2019t want to believe it was one of us, but if it was, I want you to take them down.\u201d Peabody rose as she did. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d \u201cInterview end,\u201d Eve said, and opened the file to make notes. Moments later, Peabody came back, sat. \u201cWe\u2019re not thinking she had any part of this.\u201d \u201cNo. I played with the idea she held some resentment from high school, it sparked up when Shauna\u2019s getting married, getting everything she wants. But it doesn\u2019t hold. Add physically, she couldn\u2019t have pulled it off, and I don\u2019t see her conspiring with her cohab on it. Or with Lopez. She clearly doesn\u2019t like Lopez. Tried to, but doesn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThat was my take. But we got a couple things we didn\u2019t have.\u201d \u201cYeah, Barney\u2019s WTF reaction. A different tone from Stillwater\u2019s, whether she saw it that way or not. The way she said it, Barney got a little pissy, Stillwater was surprised. And she put it down to: Guys.\u201d \u201cSome people try to see the best in people.\u201d \u201cYeah, what\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d At Peabody\u2019s laugh, Eve shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s one of them. But she doesn\u2019t like Lopez.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t want to dis her,\u201d Peabody observed. \u201cBut we\u2019re cops, it\u2019s murder, and she felt like she had to say what she knew or felt. Mean streak, doesn\u2019t like Shauna, jealous. Lopez took some shots there.\u201d \u201cYeah. Also took at least that one at Donna, which shows pattern rather than focus. We\u2019ll run Decker through it, see what meshes, what doesn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got some time before she gets here. I\u2019m going to grab something from Vending.\u201d \u201cFine.\u201d \u201cOr.\u201d Peabody stretched the word out. \u201cWe could both get something from your AutoChef and not risk ptomaine.\u201d \u201cFine. Bring it in here.\u201d \u201cGreat. What do you want?\u201d \u201cWhatever.\u201d Peabody let out a wistful sigh. \u201cI wish I could think whatever about food. My pants wouldn\u2019t just get loose, they\u2019d fall off.\u201d \u201cThen, as you tripped over them and bashed your face, I\u2019d have to arrest you for indecent exposure. After I took a vid for the bullpen\u2019s entertainment.\u201d \u201cI now see the wisdom in my non-whatever attitude regarding food. We\u2019ll have some pasta salad.\u201d \u201cHow do you know my AC stocks pasta salad?\u201d \u201cDue to my wise attitude toward food.\u201d \u201cOkay, grab the candy bar while you\u2019re at it.\u201d \u201cYou have candy in the AC? What kind?\u201d Eve gave her a long look. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you know that?\u201d \u201cI regret I did not, but I\u2019m being careful about candy because loose pants.\u201d \u201cNever mind the candy.\u201d Eve went back to her notes, but paused when Peabody went out. Her partner could be the dreaded Candy Thief, but \u2026 she was being careful about candy these days. Didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t steal the candy bar Eve hid, then reward herself for loose pants. Right now, there was an empty candy wrapper taped behind the drawing Nixie had given her. A deliberate smack at said Candy Thief. And the emergency chocolate bar resided at the back of her bottom desk drawer, which took a tool and some work to remove completely. She should check on that, just in case. By the time Peabody came back with two servings of pasta salad, Eve was again deep in her notes. \u201cReally pretty pasta salad. Colorful.\u201d Eve noted the color came not only from varicolored pasta, but also from vegetables. Well, she\u2019d said whatever, and she got it. \u201cThe motive\u2019s not money,\u201d she began, and picked up her fork. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be some deep secret, previous crime. It\u2019s sex, passion, jealousy, maybe ego. Some combination of those. Maybe all of them.\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s right, you could say killing Erin made Shauna the prize.\u201d \u201cOr killing Erin because you couldn\u2019t have her, now no one can.\u201d Peabody ate, nodded. \u201cMean streak. Lopez.\u201d \u201cOr,\u201d Eve continued, \u201ckill Erin because she took away what you wanted.\u201d \u201cTorch burning? Barney. I\u2019d lean more there if he wasn\u2019t living with Becca DiNuzio.\u201d Eve stabbed some pasta. \u201cPeople get away with affairs right under the noses of spouses, cohabs, lovers. All the damn time. And this isn\u2019t even that.\u201d \u201cUnless maybe Shauna slipped? Maybe had one more round with the high school hero. Regrets it, tells no one. \u2018A terrible mistake,\u2019 she tells Barney. \u2018Never going to happen again.\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t love you. I don\u2019t want you. I love Erin, and we\u2019ve both betrayed Becca.\u2019 He agrees, at least on the surface, accepts. But he believes if Erin\u2019s out of the picture, he can have her again. Maybe all the way, maybe on the side.\u201d \u201cIf she did it once\u201d\u2014Peabody waved her fork\u2014\u201cshe\u2019ll do it again.\u201d \u201cYou can play it with Lopez, too. She comes to the studio, Erin slips, and the same basic scenario, without the best friend added on.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like what we know of either one of them, but people slip, people cheat. And if it happened early in their relationship, it\u2019s easy to buy. Like for Shauna, is Erin really just a phase? With Erin, is Shauna really what I want?\u201d Sitting back, Eve thought it through. \u201cMira thinks it\u2019s possible the Maui trip was the trigger. The resentment, jealousy, even the thought of eliminating Erin was there, but the trip pushed the last button.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cHoneymoon. Not just the big dream, but honeymoon. Sex again.\u201d Peabody pointed. \u201cNot just sex, but dream sex. Sex in Hawaii. Romance, blue water, moonlit walks on the beach.\u201d Eve pointed back. \u201cDream sex. That\u2019s good. The killer knows they\u2019ll bang like hammers on their wedding night, but now? They\u2019ll do it in Maui. Dream sex, all romantic, passionate. Worse, Erin asks them to help make it happen, and in a big way. Asks close to the last minute because her first choice is stuck in Baltimore.\u201d \u201cShe thinks she can take me for granted?\u201d Peabody put on her mean face. \u201cThat bitch.\u201d \u201cIt could play. Now, who has a garrote lying around, or the ability to put one together fast?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d go with the first. Already has it.\u201d \u201cBecause they hope to find a way to use it, kill Erin, and not get caught for it.\u201d \u201cAnd she gives them the way.\u201d Eve tolerated a small bit of broccoli with her pasta. \u201cI come right back to the top two on the list, and it bugs the shit out of me they both work.\u201d \u201cWhat if they both work because they worked together?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m playing with that. She gets the case there, and gives him the swipe. That way, she\u2019s in the club at TOD, visible. And he waits inside the room.\u201d \u201cHitch.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know the hitches, but lay them out.\u201d \u201cWhy would they trust each other? They\u2019re in separate circles, interlinking but separate. If you\u2019re going to conspire to kill, you need more than motivation. You have to trust each other not to screw it up, or roll.\u201d \u201cTrue, but why do we so often catch people who conspire to murder?\u201d \u201cBecause they screw up or roll. But Becca\u2019s hooked with Barney, and doesn\u2019t have much to do with Lopez. They\u2019d have to know each other enough to know they want the same thing. Different reasons maybe, but the same thing.\u201d \u201cAnother hitch, unless we find he\u2019s spent some time in her club.\u201d \u201cAnd she could\u2019ve vamped him. Hey.\u201d Inspired, Peabody waved her fork. \u201cShe could\u2019ve vamped him because, first, good-looking guy, and because she knows his history with Shauna. Maybe they hatch it all together, or she says if you don\u2019t do this\u2014and you know you want to\u2014I\u2019ll tell Becca you\u2019re having an affair with me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not bad. But the hatching had to happen fast, and be well timed and executed. That\u2019s where it stops me.\u201d \u201cErin already had backup\u2014that\u2019s what she told Donna. So that means more time.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s where it opens for me, a little. Together or separately, they top the list. Rierdon\u2019s the only other one who comes close, and not close enough. No reason for Erin to have trusted him, or asked him to help her out. No reason for him to hook up with Barney on it, or Lopez if Erin tapped either of them.\u201d \u201cPlus, he\u2019s not as connected, and hasn\u2019t been since Shauna broke things off. Erin\u2019s not the reason she did. And he just didn\u2019t strike me, Dallas.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t always,\u201d Eve muttered. \u201cBut he\u2019s not striking me, either. It\u2019s too personal for someone she dated for a few months a few years ago. He\u2019d have pushed on her before, and she said he didn\u2019t.\u201d She shoved the bowl aside. \u201cWe\u2019ve got theories, angles, speculation. And nothing solid. We need some heat.\u201d \u201cDecker should be here soon. Maybe we\u2019ll get some.\u201d Eve rose to pace. \u201cThe straight best friend, long-standing. Well-off enough to buy art, know its value. Dead artist value, but that angle\u2019s soft, and it just gets softer. It\u2019s not about money. Maybe money\u2019s an added benefit, but it\u2019s not the prime motive.\u201d She grabbed her warming tube of Pepsi, drank as she paced. \u201cShe\u2019s not in love with Erin, or Shauna. Was clearly seen in the club at the time of the attack. There\u2019s no motive there, and though I still wonder why Erin didn\u2019t ask her to help her out with the surprise, no opportunity. She\u2019s fit enough, tall enough to have done it, but that\u2019s not enough. She stays low on the list.\u201d \u201cLike Becca, she might give us a couple things we don\u2019t have, or confirm some of those speculations.\u201d \u201cGotta try it. Most probable she knew Erin better than anyone. Given the length of the friendship, probably better and in more detail than Shauna. They only had a year.\u201d \u201cAn intimate year,\u201d Peabody pointed out. \u201cYeah, but it takes time for the rules to kick in, for people to see just who they\u2019re with, for the stories to come out.\u201d \u201cI guess McNab and I are still finding stuff out about each other. Not like secrets, just stuff, little bits of history and like that.\u201d Still pacing, Eve rolled the empty tube. \u201cYeah, it takes time, and they only had a year. Decker was there longer, and take out the sex, it removes a complication.\u201d And that motive, Eve thought. \u201cPlus, I\u2019m curious what she\u2019ll say about Barney and Lopez when it\u2019s just us, in here, no friends to hear her thoughts or feelings.\u201d \u201cShe comes off a little more reserved in that area than Becca.\u201d \u201cYeah, she does. We\u2019ll handle that. Let\u2019s clean this place up and get ready.\u201d \n Chapter Fourteen When Peabody escorted Angie into Interview, Eve noted not only signs of fatigue but recent weeping. Careful makeup did a good job disguising both, but still they showed. \u201cThanks for coming in,\u201d Eve began. \u201cI know this is a difficult time. Please, have a seat.\u201d Like Becca, Angie looked warily around the room. She sat, and when she spoke, even her voice sounded exhausted. \u201cAm I a suspect?\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d \u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d Peabody offered. \u201cWater. Just some water, thanks. Shauna\u2019s with Erin\u2019s family, finalizing some arrangements for tomorrow. I realized I\u2019d felt I had to hold up for her, and it was the first time I\u2019d been really alone since \u2026 since. So I fell to pieces. She was my closest friend. She was my sister. She was the one person who knew me all the way through and loved me anyway. And she\u2019s gone. She\u2019s gone.\u201d Angie closed her eyes on tears that swirled in them. \u201cSo I was alone, and I fell to pieces.\u201d Peabody laid a hand on her shoulder. \u201cYou needed to. I\u2019ll get your water. Lieutenant?\u201d \u201cThe same, thanks. Angie,\u201d she continued when Peabody stepped out, \u201cwe\u2019re doing everything we can to find the person responsible.\u201d \u201cI have to believe you are. I don\u2019t think I could stand it if I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou can help us.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how, but I\u2019ll try. Becca tagged me after you talked to her. She said you had a lot of questions, and she tried to answer. But she didn\u2019t think she helped.\u201d \u201cEvery answer to every question helps.\u201d Angie\u2019s eyes cleared as she looked at Eve. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that. I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way. Ask me anything.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to record this,\u201d Eve told her as Peabody came in with tubes of water. \u201cRecord on. Dallas, Lieutenant Eve, and Peabody, Detective Delia, in Interview with Angie Decker regarding the investigation into the murder of Erin Albright.\u201d Angie shuddered once. \u201cGod, hearing it like that. Just hearing it. \u2018The murder of Erin Albright.\u2019\u201d She let out a long breath. \u201cAsk me anything,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAgain, Angie, thanks for coming in. You helped plan the party at the Down and Dirty.\u201d \u201cYes. Becca and I\u2014Becca DiNuzio and I are\u2014were going to stand up for Erin and Shauna at the wedding. We decided, when they asked us, we\u2019d plan out the events together. The bridal shop trip, the bridal shower, the pre-wedding bash. Help with the invitations and so on.\u201d \u201cYou and Erin were very close friends, but she didn\u2019t tell you about the trip to Maui?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d After cracking the tube, Angie drank. \u201cErin loved surprises. She loved the big reveal. I knew how much she\u2019d wished she could take Shauna to Hawaii, since it was Shauna\u2019s dream honeymoon. But Shauna\u2019s very practical and Erin tries to be. Mostly succeeds, so they agreed they\u2019d put it off, save until they could do it right. I had no idea she\u2019d sold enough paintings to pull it off, or that she\u2019d booked the trip.\u201d Visibly, Angie struggled back more tears. \u201cShe would have wanted to surprise me, too. Well, all of us. Shauna at the center, and the rest of us surrounding her. That\u2019s so Erin. The costume? God, that was Erin, too. Do it large or forget about it, make it fun or what\u2019s the point?\u201d She drank again. \u201cDo you know just one more sorrow in all this? That trip? Shauna\u2019s had that dream since she was a little girl. Now she\u2019ll never be able to go. It would break her heart all over again to go. So that dream\u2019s dead, too. Maybe that\u2019s a small, silly thing, but\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cIt\u2019s not small or silly.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s holding up right now. She\u2019s so angry, and that\u2019s helping her hold up. I need to find my anger again, but right now? I\u2019m too fucking tired to be angry.\u201d \u201cShauna\u2019s staying with you.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to go back to their apartment. I can\u2019t blame her, as I\u2019m going to have a hard time going there myself. But I want to help Erin\u2019s family get her things. Becca\u2019s gotten some of Shauna\u2019s. Shauna\u2019s going to sublet it, look for another place. She can stay with me until.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s generous. You\u2019ve only known her about a year.\u201d \u201cErin loved her,\u201d Angie said simply. \u201cAnd she loved Erin. She needs a safe place, and I have the room. Erin would expect it of me.\u201d \u201cBecca doesn\u2019t have the room?\u201d \u201cBecca and Greg? No, not really. They\u2019d squeeze her in, absolutely they\u2019d do that. But I have the room\u2014a dedicated guest room, and two baths. Shauna and I have gotten to be good friends over the last year or so, with the foundation we both loved Erin.\u201d \u201cWhy do you think Erin asked Donna to bring the case to the D&D, and not you?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself over and over since we found out about the case, and I realized you think whoever did bring it killed her. If she\u2019d have asked me\u2026\u201d Angie shook her head. \u201cNo point going there. I think she asked Donna because they saw each other nearly every day, shared the studio space, and that\u2019s where Erin brought the case so Shauna didn\u2019t stumble over the surprise. And Donna thought she had a few days after the wedding before her sister had the baby.\u201d \u201cSeems like babies come when they want to,\u201d Peabody commented. \u201cYeah.\u201d As Becca had, Angie turned the tube around and around. \u201cDonna started worrying there when her sister let her know at the last visit, the midwife said it could be any day.\u201d \u201cOh?\u201d This was fresh, Eve thought. \u201cWhen was that?\u201d \u201cI \u2026 I\u2019m not sure. No, wait. It had to be last Friday. I happened to talk to Donna right after she got the news from her sister. I remember because she was so excited about the baby, but really worried about the party, and said she had to let Erin know.\u201d Angie lifted her hands. \u201cAt the time I thought she overreacted\u2014and she can do that,\u201d Angie added with a smile. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know she was supposed to bring the overnight case in for Erin.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised or shaken by the fact we believe one of your group killed Erin.\u201d Angie met Eve\u2019s gaze levelly. \u201cI suppose because I have to believe that, too. At first I had to think it was someone else, in the club, working at the club. But what sense is there in that? Someone gets in that room with her, kills her that way, and for what? The hardly anything she had of value? Some stranger just happens to get into that room when she\u2019s in there, or going in?\u201d \u201cYet your group agreed to go to the restroom in pairs or groups,\u201d Peabody pointed out. \u201cSo nobody\u2019d get hit on, or cornered. But that\u2019s not what happened to Erin. You didn\u2019t say anything about her trying to fight off something like that.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve thought about this a lot,\u201d Eve said. \u201cI have. I knew her as through and through as she knew me. She wouldn\u2019t have let anyone in that room she didn\u2019t know. If someone pushed their way in, she\u2019d have fought or tried to. So it had to be someone she knew, and she didn\u2019t get a chance to fight.\u201d Angie pressed her lips together, and her voice went raw. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have a chance. That\u2019s so much worse than a stranger, so much worse. And I want you to bury them.\u201d She shuddered again, then her shoulders stilled, straightened. \u201cAnd there it is. There\u2019s the anger. Welcome back.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d Angie\u2019s eyes, dark and hot now, met Eve\u2019s. \u201cIf I had even the faintest glimmer of an idea, I\u2019d tell you. She was\u2014she was my person, Lieutenant. The person who meant more to me than anyone in the world.\u201d \u201cAll right. Who do you think she would have asked after Donna went to Baltimore\u2014or maybe after Donna let her know she might have to go and miss the party?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m stuck there, too. I think she didn\u2019t ask me or Becca\u2014and those would be my first guesses\u2014because she didn\u2019t want to load on. And in Becca\u2019s case, maybe because Becca might slip\u2014not tell Shauna, but tell me because we were planning it all, or say something to Greg the way you do with a partner. Becca would be the first to tell you she\u2019s not always an impenetrable vault with secrets and surprises. But any of us, really.\u201d \u201cAll right, try this. Who wouldn\u2019t she ask\u2014most likely,\u201d Eve added. \u201cOh, well. Glenda, because Glenda would be in Europe. Probably not Jodi, as Jodi\u2019s so damn busy. Wanda\u2019s unlikely because also busy. Kaydee because of just what happened\u2014ER doctors have to handle emergencies.\u201d She named a few more. Moved across town, crazy workload, not altogether reliable. \u201cI don\u2019t know all of Shauna\u2019s friends well enough to say either way. Erin got to know some of them better than I did over the past year.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve still formed a pretty tight group,\u201d Peabody commented. \u201cYes, we have. I like these women, and it\u2019s hard to think one of them did this.\u201d \u201cWanda and Erin had a sexual relationship.\u201d \u201cThey did, briefly and nothing serious on either side. And honestly, I can\u2019t see Erin asking her for something like this when she knows Wanda\u2019s crowded schedule.\u201d \u201cShe also had a sexual relationship with ChiChi Lopez.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Angie drank more water. \u201cYes, she did. Erin certainly wasn\u2019t serious about it. I\u2019ve never known her to be really serious before Shauna.\u201d \u201cWas ChiChi serious?\u201d Angie set down the tube, folded her hands together on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what ChiChi takes seriously. You want to know if Erin might have asked her, and I suppose it\u2019s possible.\u201d \u201cThey maintained a friendship?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cDo you consider Lopez a friend?\u201d \u201cErin did.\u201d Angie unclasped her hands. \u201cChiChi is \u2026 can be difficult. We have certain things in common. We both grew up with certain advantages\u2014a successful family who provided emotional and financial safety nets. ChiChi has a very loving relationship with her family, as I do with mine. She has a solid work ethic, and I like to think I do as well.\u201d Eve smiled. \u201cBut?\u201d \u201cAll right, every answer to every question helps. ChiChi\u2019s either wired to or really just enjoys shooting out sharp little arrows. She\u2019s judgmental, and can be harsh\u2014deliberately harsh. She\u2019d sometimes take shots at Donna because Donna and Erin were close. Donna wouldn\u2019t tell Erin.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019d tell you?\u201d \u201cShe would, because ChiChi often took shots at me for the same reason. I could and did ignore them. Donna\u2019s more tender.\u201d \u201cSo, territorial.\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s a good term. And ego. \u2018I need to be the center of your world. Look at me.\u2019\u201d \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been thrilled about Shauna.\u201d \u201cNo. She put on a good act, but no. At the same time, she had strong, proprietary feelings for Erin. I sincerely can\u2019t see her hurting Erin like this. If it had been Shauna in that room? I could see it\u2014what\u2019s it called? Crime of passion. I could see her hurting Shauna.\u201d \u201cDid you see her, or anyone, slip out of the room between eleven-thirty and eleven-forty-five?\u201d \u201cSomething else I\u2019ve thought about countless times. I just didn\u2019t notice. Becca and Shauna were putting on a hell of a show. Jodi was up there, at least for a while, and a few others. But it was Becca and Shauna. So out of character for both of them, so just more entertaining. I was in the crowd of us, sort of half dancing, but mostly watching them and making noise. I figured Erin was, too.\u201d She looked down at the table. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think about it, and was congratulating myself for having helped plan the party that would be the queen of parties for months.\u201d \u201cHow about people outside the group of women she might have asked?\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Frowning, Angie narrowed her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that. I don\u2019t see her asking her other studio mates. Anton\u2019s a bit of a prick, and Roy\u2019s rarely around. She\u2014we, really\u2014got to be good friends with Marcus\u2014Marcus Stillwater. He loves Shauna, and he clearly came to love Erin. Shauna and Marcus go back. I could see her asking him, but again, sincerely, can\u2019t see him hurting Erin. Or anyone.\u201d She paused a moment, rubbed her temple as she thought. \u201cThere\u2019s their across-the-hall neighbors. The\u2014God, need a second. Burgers. Yeah, the Burgers. Erin gave their kid a few art lessons\u2014gratis. But I don\u2019t really see that, and why would either of them kill her? There\u2019s Clint\u2014he\u2019s with Jodi, and Erin knew him better than I did, but I can\u2019t see why she\u2019d ask him. And there\u2019s Greg\u2014you met him. Becca\u2019s guy\u2014who dated Shauna back in high school. Like Marcus, I can see Erin asking him, but can\u2019t see him hurting her.\u201d \u201cBecca mentioned both Marcus and Greg were surprised when Shauna and Erin got together.\u201d \u201cOh? Well, I\u2019m not surprised they were surprised. I was, too. But more worried, actually. That Erin would get her heart broken. Not that Shauna would do that deliberately, but that Erin was more of a fling for her. \u201cI realized differently pretty quick. So did everyone.\u201d \u201cYou never had a sexual or romantic relationship with Erin?\u201d \u201cNo. I like men for that.\u201d \u201cSo did Shauna.\u201d Angie let out a half laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s true. I\u2019ll say Erin and I never had that feeling between us\u2014and a friendship that was so strong. I haven\u2019t met a woman who\u2019s brought me that feeling. That would be one of the reasons I worried this was a fling for Shauna.\u201d \u201cWould you say there are any of those feelings with either Marcus or Greg for Shauna?\u201d \u201cMarcus and Shauna\u2014that was never romance. It was no-strings, no-worries friend sex. I\u2019d like to find a friend like that myself. Greg\u2019s got Becca, and from my viewpoint, they really work. I can\u2019t imagine him still having feelings like that for Shauna. It\u2019s more brotherly, from what I see. Sort of big brother, though they\u2019re the same age.\u201d \u201cBecca mentioned you all went to see Lopez perform at her club.\u201d \u201cYeah, we did, last fall maybe. I think about then.\u201d \u201cHow many of these men were in that group?\u201d \u201cOh, well, let me think. Not Marcus. Greg was, and Jodi\u2019s guy, and a few others who are in relationships.\u201d She shut her eyes, thought, then named four other men. \u201cI think that\u2019s it.\u201d \u201cDid Lopez join the group after her performance?\u201d \u201cFor a while\u2014she had another couple acts, but she came out awhile. I remember somebody said something about how she was mega flexible, and right in front of Shauna, she rubbed against Erin and said how Erin always liked that about her.\u201d Scowling, Angie nudged the tube of water aside. \u201cIt was crude and uncalled for. But Shauna? She just laughed, then bent her leg up behind her\u2014grabbed her ankle and bent her leg up over her head. And said like \u2018Me, too.\u2019\u201d The scowl turned into a smile. \u201cI fell in love with her for that. I liked she set a tone. \u2018You don\u2019t bother me, sister.\u2019 And I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m giving you the wrong impression, because ChiChi often rubs me wrong. It\u2019s a personality thing. But again, there\u2019s no way I can see her hurting Erin. As much as she\u2019s capable, she loves Erin. Loved her.\u201d \u201cUnderstood. You\u2019ve been helpful, Angie. We appreciate you coming in, taking the time.\u201d \u201cI feel \u2026 After saying all this, talking like this, it had to be a stranger after all. It doesn\u2019t make sense. But neither does it being one of us.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnd there goes the anger.\u201d \u201cSave it for when we find who killed her. Detective Peabody and I will attend the memorial tomorrow if at all possible.\u201d \u201cThat would be good. I think it would be good for everyone to see you there, to know it matters\u2014Erin matters\u2014to you.\u201d \u201cShe does. Interview end. Detective Peabody will show you out.\u201d As before, Eve stayed where she was, added to her notes. Then rose when Peabody came back. \u201cLet\u2019s log and file the recordings.\u201d \u201cSometimes you\u2019re too close to see.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Eve agreed. \u201cNeither of them can see one of them putting that wire around Erin Albright\u2019s neck. Neither of them much like Lopez\u2014personality thing\u2014but they can\u2019t see her doing it.\u201d \u201cYou do?\u201d \u201cI can see it. Doesn\u2019t mean she did it, but I can see it. And she slides into Mira\u2019s quick profile neat enough. We\u2019re going to do a run on all the names she gave us\u2014the men who went with the group to the club. That connects to Lopez.\u201d As they started out, Peabody shook her head. \u201cThat snark at the club\u2014about Erin liking the flexible? Nasty, and designed to cut Shauna, to piss her off not just at Lopez but at Erin.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t work.\u201d \u201cProbably did a little, but she deflected. I haven\u2019t even met Lopez yet, and I already don\u2019t like her much.\u201d \u201cYou should have a chance tomorrow. She\u2019ll probably be there. And whether or not it\u2019s her, the killer\u2019s likely to be there.\u201d She checked the time. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll do the runs, write this up. You go by the shoe store. Let\u2019s see if Lopez ever came in\u2014or anyone else in the group\u2014and gave Shauna any trouble. I can\u2019t see her not telling Becca if so, but maybe not.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re sending me to a shoe store! Solo!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m saving myself the aggravation of watching you drool on shoes before I have to kick my own footwear up your ass.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the recordings, and maybe see how close McNab is to closing down. He doesn\u2019t mind when I drool.\u201d \u201cJust get it done. I think we have enough to justify another conversation with Lopez. After the memorial. Before, I think we talk to Stillwater again, and to Barney.\u201d \u201cThe first as a wit\u2014observations, impressions\u2014the second as suspect?\u201d \u201cIn that order, yeah.\u201d Eve turned into her office. With coffee, she sat first to write up the report\u2014and decided what the hell, to copy Mira. If/when you have a chance, I\u2019d like your opinion. Both recordings are logged and filed. The victim\u2019s memorial is tomorrow, and I expect to have more observations and conduct more interviews. Appreciate any time you have. Dallas Fishing, Eve thought as she started the runs. But if she put any credence in Angie\u2019s opinion of who Erin might have asked\u2014and she did\u2014the pool had shrunk somewhat. She had a friendship like theirs\u2014the through and through sort. Mavis could have answered that question on the mark. Peabody, too, she decided. Partnership, when it worked, held intimacy. God knew Roarke had that through and through, and still there were things Mavis knew he didn\u2019t. Not secrets, but as Peabody had said, just things from before that hadn\u2019t come up. She remembered asking him once why he didn\u2019t have a big-ass boat, since he had every-damn-thing. And he\u2019d told her about a storm at sea during his smuggling days. She hadn\u2019t known because it had never come up before. But credence or not, she did the runs, as it was possible the killer had a partner. Once done, she decided to either close that door or open it a crack wider and contacted all four. Routine inquiry, blah blah. Two served as each other\u2019s alibi. Poker game, monthly deal\u2014with three others. Broke up at midnight. Easily checked and verified, so she did. The third worked the night shift as an MT\u2014also easily checked and verified. The last, no longer with the woman he\u2019d been with at the club, claimed to be home, in bed. But not alone. Eve checked and verified. Smaller pool, Eve thought as she rose. Her gut told her Lopez and Barney remained most likely. And so had Angie Decker\u2019s take on her friend. She headed down to the garage and decided she\u2019d swing by the victim\u2019s apartment, see if she could talk to those neighbors. Impressions again of who visited, how often. She didn\u2019t have far to go, but the traffic made it feel a lot farther. She found parking, considered it a bonus, and walked through the hot August evening toward the apartment building. A lot of sweaty people had ended their workday, headed for happy hour or home, an after-work appointment, an early vid with a friend. She hoped the Burgers had ended their workday and chosen home. She mastered into the building and headed up. Plenty in the building, from the sound of it, had chosen home. No baby screaming this time, but an older kid\u2019s maniacal laughter that reminded her of Bella. And reminded her about the damn chair she had to make sure about before Mavis\u2019s second kid came along. When the hell was that, and how could she get out of witnessing another birth and having those images burned freshly in her brain? \u201cDon\u2019t think about it,\u201d she muttered, and came out on the fourth floor. Since she heard another kid proclaiming loudly that she pooped in the toilet, which was followed by adult cheers and applause, she figured her luck was in. The woman who answered the buzz had short blond hair, wore a black linen dress that had wilted some, and had bare feet. Eve could smell whatever was for dinner\u2014and decided Chinese takeout. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d Eve held up her badge; before she could speak, the woman glanced back. \u201cAllen, I need to step into the hall with the p-o-l-i-c-e.\u201d She eased the door shut but for a crack. \u201cThis is about Erin. We\u2019re sick about it. I don\u2019t want our daughters to hear yet. They\u2019re too young.\u201d \u201cDaddy, wipe my butt!\u201d \u201cPotty training,\u201d Ms. Burger said. \u201cShe\u2019s very proud. So are we.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just awful. She was a sweetheart. Both of them. Erin gave Trixie art lessons.\u201d Burger smiled. \u201cOur older girl. She\u2019s six. It was so sweet of Erin to take the time.\u201d \u201cSince you live across the hall, you might have noticed visitors.\u201d \u201cSome, sure. They had a lot of friends. No loud parties, which we appreciate. I mean we could hear some\u2014the soundproofing doesn\u2019t exist here\u2014but they weren\u2019t obnoxious.\u201d \u201cThis is just a routine inquiry. Can I show you some photos? Just to get a sense who visited, how often?\u201d \u201cSure. Oh yes.\u201d Burger studied Angie\u2019s ID shot. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name? Andi\u2014no, Angie. Angie and the other\u2014pretty hair. Becca! They were here a lot, especially in the last few months. Helping with the wedding.\u201d She stopped, teared up a little. \u201cOh, it\u2019s so awful. I haven\u2019t seen Shauna since it happened, but I just want to hug her. Becca\u2019s been by\u2014she told me what happened\u2014to get some of her things. And the\u2014God\u2014their wedding dresses.\u201d \u201cYes. How about this one?\u201d Burger studied Lopez. \u201cI think so, yes. Not like the other two. But I remember riding up on the elevator with her.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cA little snooty, which Erin and Shauna aren\u2019t.\u201d Eve went through the photos, got positives, negatives, then brought up Barney\u2019s. \u201cSure, sure. Sometimes with the one with the pretty hair\u2014Becca. I think they\u2019re together. Sometimes by himself. Sharp dresser, that one. I remember. I rode up with him and Shauna just last week, I think.\u201d \u201cThe two of them?\u201d \u201cYes. I guess we all got off work at about the same time. Her work\u2019s not far from here. I guess it was about twenty minutes later when they went out again. I rode down with them\u2014she\u2019d changed her clothes. It was my turn to do the laundry, so I ended up riding down with them after I changed mine. We laughed about it. \u201cI was heading down to the laundry, and they were heading out to meet their cohabs for dinner. I said I\u2019d rather go to dinner with them, something like that. Seems to me he\u2019d walk home with her now and then. I think Erin said they\u2019d been friends since high school. That\u2019s sweet.\u201d \u201cYeah, well, thanks. I\u2019m sorry to interrupt your evening.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all. I really liked her. Both of them. Just the kind of neighbors you want. I hope you find who did this.\u201d Eve waited until she\u2019d gone in, then turned to look across the hall. She\u2019d heard movement in there, and debated going in or just waiting. She didn\u2019t have to decide, as the door opened. Greg Barney stepped out carrying a large, lidded box. He jolted, blinked, then let out a breath. \u201cJesus, you startled me. Did you need to go inside again? We thought you were done, but I can let you in.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right, just a routine check on my way home. What\u2019s in the box?\u201d \u201cOh, stuff from the friggie, the AC. Becca thought of it\u2014she thinks of things. Since Shauna doesn\u2019t want to come back, Becca said we should clear those out. Not that much in there, really.\u201d He glanced back. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even feel like their place anymore. It already feels empty, even though the furniture\u2019s there, and dishes and all that. Becca\u2019s been coming by to get things for Shauna. And Angie\u2019s going to help Erin\u2019s family get her things.\u201d He looked back at Eve. \u201cThe memorial\u2019s tomorrow.\u201d \u201cYes, I know. Shauna\u2019s lucky to have friends who\u2019d do this sort of thing for her.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. A quick stop after work. She doesn\u2019t even want this.\u201d He shifted the box. \u201cBecca said just take it to our place. We can do the food bank thing or something. It\u2019s not that much.\u201d He shifted his feet, shifted the box. \u201cBut, um, there\u2019s some perishables from the friggie, so\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll ride down with you.\u201d And wished she\u2019d had a warrant or probable cause to look in the damn box. \u201cHow\u2019s Shauna doing?\u201d she asked as they waited for the elevator. \u201cShe\u2019s fragile right now, maybe still in shock. Hardly eating, not really sleeping. But she\u2019s stronger than people think.\u201d \u201cPeople?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s little, you know. Petite.\u201d He got in the elevator car, pressed for the lobby. \u201cSo people think she\u2019s delicate. She\u2019s going through a lot right now, but she\u2019ll be okay.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re there to help her.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely. Are you making any progress? I know it hasn\u2019t been very long.\u201d \u201cI think so, yes. We\u2019re following leads.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good news.\u201d He shifted the box again. \u201cIt had to be somebody in the club, some lowlife, right? I wish they hadn\u2019t gone to a place like that. A group of women going to a place like that. I don\u2019t mean to be critical, but it just seems like a bad choice. And it was, as it turns out. It was.\u201d He waited for Eve to step out in the lobby, then tried to juggle the box to get the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d \u201cThanks. Not heavy, but awkward. I guess you deal with this all the time. I mean, it\u2019s a job. For us, it\u2019s trauma, tragedy. I hope you find that lowlife so Shauna can start putting this behind her. Maybe somebody who works there. That seems the most logical, doesn\u2019t it? Somebody who works in a place like that.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all possibilities. Do you need a ride? I\u2019m parked right down there.\u201d \u201cOh, no, thanks. Not going far, and it\u2019s really not heavy. Have a good evening.\u201d She watched him walk away. The helpful friend, she thought. The very nervous helpful friend trying to dig out information on the investigation. And he had something in that damn box that wasn\u2019t out of the AC or friggie. Something to think about. And since the shoe place was only a handful of blocks, she\u2019d think about it and walk down there. \n Chapter Fifteen Before she reached the intersection, her \u2019link signaled. She saw Roarke on the display, then his face on-screen. Those brilliant blue eyes smiled at her. \u201cLieutenant.\u201d \u201cCivilian.\u201d \u201cOut and about again, are you? As I am. A meeting downtown that ran over. Where might you be?\u201d \u201cHeading to a shoe store downtown.\u201d \u201cBefore I have a slight stroke due to shock, I\u2019ll assume this is fieldwork.\u201d \u201cYour brain\u2019s safe. I had another stop in the area.\u201d She joined the river of pedestrians crossing at the Walk signal. \u201cPeabody\u2019s probably already there, but I\u2019m this close anyway now.\u201d \u201cGive me the address. I\u2019ll meet you and catch a ride home.\u201d She gave it to him. \u201cShould be a quick stop.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be quick as well, as I\u2019m also close.\u201d She slid the \u2019link back in her pocket, discovered her sunshades, and put them on. On her right, a maxibus wheezed its way to a stop. People flooded off like refugees. A trio of teenage boys, all in identical black baggies, strutted out of the flood and into a gaming store. A woman with blond hair down to her ass sashayed\u2014the only word for it. She wore purple micro shorts, a matching tank, and sandals with a three-inch platform that showed off purple toenails. She carried a big flowered bag on her shoulder. A tiny, pointy-eared dog peeked out of it and goggled at Eve. Thinking of Galahad, she gave the purse-dog a wide berth. Two women headed up the block, both of them hauling shopping bags with the Fancy Feet logo. As they passed her, she heard one of them say: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like hitting an end-of-season sale!\u201d Why were there seasons for sales? Eve wondered. If the season was ending, did you have to wait until the next year to wear what you bought at the end of the season? Then you\u2019d probably hit the preseason sales and end up with a closet full of pre stuff and end-of stuff before you bought in-season stuff. A sickness, she decided. It was all a sickness. Pleased to be healthy in that regard, she paused at the store, studied the signs announcing that end-of-season sale. UP TO 50 % OFF! LIMITED SIZES! END YOUR SUMMER ON FASHIONABLE FEET! Fashionable feet apparently meant sandals\u2014platform, heeled, flats. Or open-toed shoes. Open-toed boots, which made virtually no sense whatsoever to her mind. A lot of candy colors, or more inexplicably to her, the clear ones that exposed your entire foot. But as she opened the door to mild chaos, she decided the marketing just worked. At least a dozen people sat on tiny scoop chairs or narrow benches, both with piles of shoes scattered like shrapnel. More crowded the shelves and racks while clerks hustled to bring more boxes out, take more boxes away. The noise level reached awesome. She spotted Peabody and McNab toward the back with a mid-twenties Asian woman in New York black and those weird clear, open-toed boots. She began to weave and dodge her way back. Peabody saw her coming. \u201cOh, hey. Lieutenant Dallas, this is Mae-Lu, the assistant manager. Mae-Lu was about to tell us about an encounter with Ms. Lopez.\u201d \u201cTruth,\u201d Mae-Lu said, and spoke in a voice that rang with Queens. \u201cSo she comes in\u2014the one in the picture they showed me, yeah? This is like back last fall before I got promoted, and we weren\u2019t swamped like today, yeah? We had some customers, but Roxy had them and I was free, so I asked if I could show her something, and she gives a look that\u2019s all: As if, and says she wants the manager.\u201d \u201cDid she ask for her by name?\u201d Eve wondered. \u201cNope, just \u2018the manager,\u2019 and I thought how uh-oh, she\u2019s one of those, come in to bitch about something. So I went in the back where Shauna was handling some things, and told her. She comes out, and she says like: \u2018Oh, hi, ChiChi\u2019\u2014I remember the name because my aunt has a cat named ChiChi. Anyway, the woman says how she wants to look at some shoes, which I could\u2019ve helped her with, yeah? But Shauna takes care of her.\u201d \u201cSo she bought shoes?\u201d Mae-Lu shifted on her invisible open-toed boots, then set a fist on her cocked hip. \u201cNope, here\u2019s the thing. I got busy with a customer, then I noticed how the ChiChi woman\u2019s sitting there, with a bunch of shoes and boxes all around\u2014that happens\u2014but she\u2019s being bitchy about it, and she\u2019s got Shauna down on the floor, putting her shoes on like she\u2019s freaking Cinderella, yeah? \u201cWe weren\u2019t all that busy, like I said, but I bet I served three customers while this one\u2019s sending Shauna back and forth. So when I\u2019m free again, I go over and ask if I can take some of the shoes back for Shauna, and Ms. Cinderella gives me that look again, and she says how a manager should be able to manage.\u201d Expressively, Mae-Lu rolled her gorgeous onyx eyes. \u201cThen she puts her own shoes back on and says how there\u2019s nothing in this store worth having. And gives Shauna that nasty look and says: \u2018Nothing at all.\u2019 Then she walked out like the queen or whatever. I said something like, you know, \u2018Whew, rude much,\u2019 but Shauna\u2019s all \u2018It\u2019s no big.\u2019\u201d Mae-Lu shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s the manager, yeah. She rolls. Anyway. We put all the shoes away, and I can see she\u2019s a little steamed, a little upset, but she just goes back to work, yeah? Shauna\u2019s totally professional, and really nice, too. She put me up for promotion. I\u2019m really, really sorry about what happened to her fianc\u00e9e.\u201d Those onyx eyes went damp. \u201cShe\u2019d come in once in a while\u2014Erin. Everybody liked her.\u201d \u201cDid ChiChi ever come in again?\u201d \u201cNot while I was working, and I\u2019d probably have heard if she did from one of the other staff. Because, whoa, talk about \u2019tude. And not the good kind, yeah?\u201d \u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d \u201cUm, if you talk to Shauna, just tell her we\u2019re all really sorry. And we\u2019re going to cover things here, yeah? Not to worry about any of it. I need to get back to it. Our big sales rock it out.\u201d \u201cGo ahead. Thanks again.\u201d She turned to Peabody. \u201cLet\u2019s step outside.\u201d And out of the mayhem to where Roarke in his perfect suit stood on the sidewalk perusing the shoes on display. \u201cHello, Peabody, Ian. Lieutenant. Quite a busy hive in there, I see.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all that,\u201d Peabody agreed. \u201cA really good sale.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Eve said. \u201cHard not to. I didn\u2019t expect you guys.\u201d \u201cI decided to go by, talk to the neighbor. I\u2019m parked there.\u201d Eve pointed. \u201cWalk and talk.\u201d Though Peabody gave the store a wistful glance, she fell in line. Roarke strolled behind them with McNab prancing by his side. Eve heard them launch into some e-geek thing about the Great House Project, and tuned them out. \u201cI talked to Ms. Burger\u2014she recognized several photos.\u201d \u201cFriends drop by, come around, pop in.\u201d \u201cThese did. Including Lopez\u2014Burger deemed her snooty.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not wrong.\u201d \u201cShe states that Barney sometimes came in with Shauna, like after work. Sometimes came with Becca, but sometimes alone. And he came out of the apartment while I was there, carrying a box. Pretty good-sized box.\u201d \u201cOf what?\u201d \u201cSince I didn\u2019t have a warrant, I can\u2019t verify. He said, at Becca\u2019s suggestion, he came over to clear out the friggie and the AC.\u201d \u201cOh, well, that makes sense.\u201d \u201cIt does. He literally jolted when he saw me in the hallway. He was nervous.\u201d Beside Eve, Peabody weaved through pedestrians. \u201cI gotta say, cops can do that to people. You really can do that to people.\u201d \u201cProudly. He asked about the case, also not out of line, but pushed, a couple times, that it had to be some lowlife\u2014his word\u2014on the staff, or in the club outside the group. \u201cNot like Decker,\u201d Eve continued. \u201cNot that tone. Hers was rooted in hope and grief. His was like he wanted to nudge me there or find out if that\u2019s where we focused.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re leaning toward him.\u201d \u201cLopez is still in the running. Going into her rival\u2019s workplace, taking that time, wasting Shauna\u2019s time, and trying to humiliate her. And risking Shauna would complain about it to Erin.\u201d When they reached the car, Eve stopped. \u201cLopez didn\u2019t just get replaced in bed, she got outdone. Her type can\u2019t stand for that. She had to know she risked getting cut out completely with that stunt, but she did it anyway.\u201d \u201cLack of control.\u201d \u201cYeah, and that need to humiliate, to take the power. And Barney\u2019s the hoverer. He made noises about how they should never have had the party in a place like the D&D. He didn\u2019t come out and say Erin was asking for it, but it was implied.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m starting not to like him, either.\u201d \u201cAnd he had something in that box. Something he took out of there that wasn\u2019t from the AC or friggie. The way he looked, the way he held it.\u201d Eve looked back toward the apartment building. Can\u2019t verify, she thought. But know it. \u201cI need to sort through this. Pile in. We\u2019ll give you a lift.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to the house. You can just drop us off,\u201d Peabody said when she read Eve\u2019s face. \u201cI mean, Mavis\u2019s gang is there, and they\u2019d be sad to miss you, but you could just drop us off.\u201d \u201cTen minutes.\u201d She shot Roarke a look. \u201cTen.\u201d \u201cYour call, darling. Why don\u2019t I drive? Ian, we\u2019ll just take a very quick look at the comm system while we\u2019re there.\u201d \u201cMag. Clicking in the house-to-house would be handy.\u201d He piled in. \u201cShe-Body, you sure you don\u2019t want them to drop us at the apartment? Grab a couple of the boxes?\u201d \u201cWell\u2026\u201d In the front seat, Eve felt more time ticking away. \u201cFine. Fine. We\u2019ll go by there, wait, and take you to the house.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be fast,\u201d Peabody promised. \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d She ignored Roarke\u2019s amused look, and put her mind back in work mode as he drove. \u201cI want to talk to Stillwater again. He\u2019s not on the list, but he\u2019s in the group. He\u2019ll have impressions. It\u2019s a stupid murder. It gains nothing. And it\u2019s not the batshit kind, either. There\u2019s motive in there, specific target, but where\u2019s the gain?\u201d \u201cShauna can\u2019t marry a dead woman,\u201d Peabody pointed out. \u201cYeah, and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got.\u201d Roarke slid into a parking space outside the apartment building. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d Eve demanded. \u201cHow do you just find parking right where we\u2019re going? What, do you bribe the parking gods?\u201d \u201cEvery chance I get.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be fast,\u201d Peabody promised as she and McNab climbed out. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lightning.\u201d Eve watched them dash, hands linked, to the building. \u201cFriendships probe around, find the guilt, until you\u2019re waiting outside an apartment in a parked car.\u201d Roarke patted her hand. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long. And consider this. Friendships, healthy or unhealthy, are very much a part of your investigation.\u201d \u201cThey crisscross all over. But no one I\u2019ve talked to, once I dig down a little, much liked Lopez. Erin must have. If it had just been sex, she\u2019d have eased away over the last year. But she didn\u2019t. Everybody seems to like Barney, Mr. Helpful who hovers.\u201d \u201cFrom the sound of it, you don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cHe was nervous,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhy was he nervous? Okay, first, seeing me in the hall\u2014a jolt. Not expected. But after.\u201d \u201cAnd you think there was something else in the box.\u201d \u201cI do. But I can\u2019t imagine what. We went through the place, and there was nothing incriminating. But he was nervous.\u201d They weren\u2019t lightning, but fast enough as they came out, each carrying a box, lidded, as Barney had. Eve noted theirs were sealed and labeled as, from behind the wheel, Roarke popped the trunk. \u201cBig thanks,\u201d Peabody said as she slid back in the car. \u201cGetting stuff over there this way\u2019s going to make the final move a lot easier, and we can put in more time helping next door.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t want Mavis carting too much,\u201d McNab added. \u201cAnd when August isn\u2019t there, somebody\u2019s gotta keep an eye on Bella.\u201d Friendships, Eve thought again, they sucked you right in. \u201cMavis tagged us as we were heading up,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cWanted to know if we\u2019d make it tonight. She\u2019s juiced you\u2019re coming by. I told her you couldn\u2019t stay long. She gets it.\u201d Well, that was something anyway. The gates opened as they drove up, and there was the family, sitting in the brightly colored chairs on the big front porch. Bella, hair in two high tails on either side of her head, in bibbed shorts as blue as her eyes, popped out of her kid-sized chair. Mavis didn\u2019t pop, but sort of levered herself up. Eve didn\u2019t know how\u2014it hadn\u2019t been that long\u2014but the belly under the snug green tee was bigger than ever. The tee matched the color of the explosive topknot of hair and the swirls all over the white tennis shoes. Leonardo, the gentle giant, took Mavis\u2019s hand and stood with her in a flowing sleeveless shirt and baggies that cropped at his ankles. The minute Eve opened the car door, Bella shot off the porch. \u201cDas here! Das, Ork, Peadoby, Nab. Friends!\u201d That seemed to be the theme of the day, Eve decided as she caught the flying blond rocket. \u201cHi, hi, hi!\u201d Bella beamed and gave Eve an enthusiastic and sloppy kiss. \u201cI\u2019ve got this, Peabody.\u201d Roarke lifted a box from the trunk. \u201cThanks. You can just take it around to our side.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll drop them off, take a look at the comm system,\u201d McNab told her. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lightning,\u201d he said to Eve. She carted the now babbling Bella to the porch. \u201cI know you can\u2019t stay\u2014bummer.\u201d She embraced Eve, sandwiching both the kid and the one yet to come between them. \u201cBut I made lemonade! I mean made-made from the recipe Summerset gave me. Who knew? And I totally, abso didn\u2019t screw it up, did I, moonpie?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d The pitcher, glasses, an ice bucket sat on a tray on a table. \u201cSounds good.\u201d \u201cDas pray!\u201d Eve could only stare. \u201cShe wants me to pray? For what?\u201d \u201cBella.\u201d Mavis laughed as Leonardo poured out lemonade. \u201cPl-pl-pl.\u201d \u201cPl-pl-pl-ay. Das play.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t do that, either.\u201d Even if she knew how. \u201cI have to go to work in a minute.\u201d \u201cAww.\u201d \u201cMaybe just come inside a minute. See what you think. Let\u2019s show Dallas, baby girl of mine.\u201d \u201cSee, see!\u201d Bella scrambled down, and when Mavis opened the door, shot inside. Lemonade in hand, Eve followed. In the entrance the walls were \u2026 what were they? Eve wondered. Orange. But not like an actual orange or a pumpkin, but a deeper, maybe a softer tone that somehow worked against the thick, dark millwork. Overhead, a many-armed light hung from a ceiling medallion. Most of the floor lay under some sort of protective paper, but what she could see gleamed. \u201cI love the light!\u201d Mavis grinned at Peabody. \u201cI know! They just got it up today. They\u2019re nearly done in here.\u201d The entrance gave way to the living area, walls the same color, evening sun still streaming in the windows. The fireplace, with its thick, carved frame, looked old, important. For the built-ins that flanked it, she\u2019d chosen green\u2014deep and soft again. \u201cI\u2019ve got to have color. Just have to have it.\u201d \u201cI see that. And it works.\u201d Rather than detracting from the old and important, the colors just enhanced that focus. \u201cIt feels like home.\u201d Leonardo looked around with an expression of utter contentment. \u201cEven without furniture, it\u2019s already home.\u201d Eve remembered Peabody had said exactly the same. \u201cRoarke said we can start moving in furniture next week, in here for sure, which is beyond mag. And over in the parlor or sitting room. Over here.\u201d Stroking her baby belly, she crossed the hall to a smaller space done in a rich, saturated blue. \u201cI think more like a den or whatever because the sofa I got for here says take a nap, and you can close the room off with the pocket doors.\u201d \u201cThe lighting\u2019s really good,\u201d Peabody observed. \u201cIt\u2019s all coordinated but not matchy. It\u2019s modern, but it slides into the old with just the right tension.\u201d \u201cI had a lot of help. You, Leonardo, Roarke.\u201d \u201cIt looks good,\u201d Eve said. \u201cReally good. It looks like the three of you.\u201d \u201cAnybody home?\u201d McNab\u2019s voice came through a speaker somewhere. \u201cThey made it work!\u201d Baby belly jiggled and swayed as Mavis bounced. She dashed over to a switch on the wall. \u201cWe\u2019re here! You fixed it! Big slooch!\u201d \u201cHi, hi, hi,\u201d Bella shouted. \u201cHi, Nab.\u201d \u201cHey, Bellamini. Be right over.\u201d Still bouncing, Mavis turned back. \u201cMcNab wanted to add that feature. The house-to-house dealie.\u201d She patted her mountain of belly. \u201cHe said they want to be on alert when Number Two decides it\u2019s time.\u201d \u201cThen for sure,\u201d Peabody agreed, and scooped Bella up. \u201cAnd down the road, it\u2019s just convenience.\u201d \u201cAdded security.\u201d Mavis rolled her eyes, but smiled. \u201cI know you guys.\u201d When Roarke and McNab came in, Bella deserted Peabody to launch at him. \u201cThere\u2019s that pretty girl.\u201d \u201cOrk pretty,\u201d she said, and batted her eyes. He laughed with her, then looked up. \u201cLights look just right, and I\u2019ll say the same about what I saw installed at your place, Peabody. Well done, all.\u201d \u201cWell done, all,\u201d Bella echoed, and batted her lashes again. \u201cAgreed, but we\u2019ve got to go.\u201d \u201cThanks for the lift,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cMega thanks.\u201d \u201cNo problem.\u201d \u201cCome back.\u201d Mavis sandwiched again, fiercely. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got real time. There\u2019s a lot more done, both sides, and too totally awesome. I want the Dallas seal of approval.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve already got it, but yeah, when I\u2019ve got real time. And you rocked the lemonade,\u201d she said, and handed the glass back to her. \u201cI really did! Tell Summerset!\u201d \u201cSomebody will.\u201d \u201cHere now, Bella, go to your da. We\u2019ll see you again soon.\u201d \u201cBye, bye, bye. Bye-bye, Ork, bye-bye Das.\u201d She blew kisses from Leonardo\u2019s hip as they started out. \u201cThere now.\u201d Roarke got behind the wheel. \u201cThat didn\u2019t take much time.\u201d \u201cNot much.\u201d She glanced back. The whole group stood on the porch. Like family. Friends. All those connections crisscrossing. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be stupid happy. They already are, but even more stupid happy. The house-to-house? Good idea.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t initially suggest it. Some might find it intrusive. They don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve merged. Yeah, they\u2019ll have their separate spaces, separate lives, and all that. But they\u2019ve merged.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s been lovely to watch. You\u2019re tense.\u201d \u201cAm I?\u201d She circled her shoulders, felt the twinges. \u201cMaybe some.\u201d She remembered she\u2019d thought about a swim, but friendship had eaten that time away on her mental schedule. \u201cTell me about today. It\u2019ll relax you to talk it out.\u201d \u201cIt will. Is that weird?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s you, Lieutenant. And when we\u2019re home, we\u2019ll add a glass of wine, a meal.\u201d \u201cI had pasta salad for lunch.\u201d He glanced over. \u201cVoluntarily?\u201d \u201cPeabody did it. And considering how much hiking we\u2019ve done around New York the past couple days, probably a good thing.\u201d \u201cEating lunch isn\u2019t a sign of weakness.\u201d \u201cNo, I just don\u2019t think about it most days. We stuffed a lot of walking and talking in this one,\u201d she said, and told him. By the time they drove through their own gates, she had relaxed, at least a little. \u201cWine wouldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d she decided. \u201cI need to rearrange my board, write some things up, and I want to talk to Marcus Stillwater. But wine wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He took her hand as they walked to the house. \u201cAny contact with dogs today?\u201d \u201cNone. I should be safe.\u201d And when they walked in, the cat, sitting beside Summerset, padded over to ribbon through her legs. \u201cLate,\u201d Summerset noted, \u201cbut unbloodied.\u201d \u201cWe ended up taking Peabody and McNab to the house,\u201d Roarke told him. \u201cAh, and it\u2019s coming along beautifully, I thought. I had a tour today when I took over some lemons.\u201d Instead of a snide remark, Eve felt obliged to tell him, \u201cShe did the lemonade. It worked.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a quick study, Mavis.\u201d Leaving it there, Eve started up the stairs. \u201cShe feels pressed,\u201d Roarke observed, \u201cbut she made time for them.\u201d \u201cLove always finds a way. There\u2019s some nice barbecued chicken. It would go well with the fries the Lieutenant is so fond of.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ll see to it. Thanks.\u201d He went up to find her already shed of her jacket and at her board. \u201cWant to do this first, want the visual. Then I want to contact Stillwater. Then\u2014\u201d \u201cWine and a meal before the rest.\u201d It seemed fair enough. \u201cGive me twenty.\u201d \u201cTwenty it is.\u201d And he went into his own office. Once she had the visual, she stepped back, nodded. She leaned where she leaned, she admitted. But she\u2019d get Stillwater\u2019s take. Then see what she\u2019d see at the memorial. She needed a lot more than leaning. At her command center, she tried Stillwater. He answered right away. \u201cLieutenant, is it done?\u201d \u201cIf you mean have we made an arrest, no.\u201d His eyes went from hopeful to deflated. \u201cI guess I hoped, when I saw your name on the display. I just left Angie\u2019s. We finally talked Shauna into eating something, and lying down awhile. Rough day for her.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure it was. Who else was there?\u201d \u201cAt Angie\u2019s? I started to say the usual suspects, but that sounds really wrong given the circumstances. Angie, of course, Becca, Greg, Donna. Donna left when I did.\u201d \u201cI ran into Greg at Shauna\u2019s apartment building.\u201d \u201cOh? He didn\u2019t mention it. I think he went by to clear out food. Shauna doesn\u2019t want to go back. I can\u2019t blame her.\u201d She could see what she took to be his apartment behind him. Pale gray wall, enormous screen flanked by darker gray shelves. Like Roarke, he had real books. \u201cMr. Stillwater\u2014\u201d \u201cMarcus. It\u2019s Marcus.\u201d \u201cMarcus, do you know ChiChi Lopez?\u201d \u201cSure, a little. Not really well. The family restaurant\u2019s great.\u201d \u201cEver been to the club where she performs? Delights?\u201d \u201cI actually haven\u2019t. I\u2019m more hands-on getting a woman naked, I guess, but I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s talented.\u201d \u201cRight. At the moment I\u2019m asking for impressions. We can start with her.\u201d \u201cOkay, but like I said, I don\u2019t know her all that well. Sexy, confident, a little \u2026 hard isn\u2019t exactly the word. Edgy might be better.\u201d \u201cAnd her relationship with Erin?\u201d \u201cThat ended with Shauna\u2014the sex part of it. Not that they didn\u2019t have a friendship after, or I guess I wouldn\u2019t have met her at all.\u201d \u201cImpressions again. How did she feel about Shauna, Shauna and Erin?\u201d \u201cImpressions? Not especially warm.\u201d He hesitated, moving around as he did so she caught more pieces of his living space. And what she believed was an Erin Albright cityscape. \u201cOkay, she didn\u2019t like Shauna. At least Shauna told me she didn\u2019t, and Shauna didn\u2019t much like her back. I think she told me rather than Becca or Erin because, well, I\u2019m not one of the girls. Shauna didn\u2019t want to make waves. ChiChi was Erin\u2019s friend, and she didn\u2019t want to cause trouble between them.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI figured the same. Why muck things up? And told her I thought it would smooth out as time went. You don\u2019t think ChiChi\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just gathering impressions. What about Greg Barney?\u201d \u201cI know him better. Nice guy. We don\u2019t hang much, but he\u2019s a nice guy. Really into fashion, schedules, but that\u2019s what he does. He and Becca have a good rhythm. He\u2019s like a big brother with Shauna, from my POV. Sometimes it crowded her\u2014she told me\u2014but he meant well. They had a thing back in high school.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d \u201cBut there wasn\u2019t any animosity, not that I ever saw, or she ever told me. I think she would have. She and Becca are really tight. More good rhythm. That wouldn\u2019t happen if there were old scars, you know what I mean? So no scars, my impression, but a bond, between all three.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s aware you and Shauna had a sexual relationship?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d Now he sat in a black scoop chair. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a problem with it\u2014not that I could tell anyway. Even when Shauna and I weren\u2019t planning on having sex, the four of us went out sometimes. To dinner, a club, just for drinks. He treated her more like a sister than an ex.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d She took him through others in the group, to round it out. And decided he was observant, fairly insightful. \u201cI appreciate the time,\u201d she said when Roarke came in and walked to the wine cabinet. \u201cIt helps to get different perspectives on Erin\u2019s circle of friends.\u201d \u201cShe had a wide one, and a good one, I think. I expect all of them will be at the memorial tomorrow. Shauna\u2019s going in with her parents and Erin\u2019s. I\u2019m going to try to go in with Angie and Donna if I can juggle some things.\u201d \u201cDetective Peabody and I plan to come, pay our respects. Again, thanks for your time.\u201d \u201cAnything that helps, just let me know. She was my friend, too.\u201d \u201cI know, and I will. Goodbye.\u201d Eve clicked off, sat back. \u201cWas that helpful?\u201d \u201cMaybe. Maybe.\u201d He opened a chilled bottle of sauvignon blanc. \u201cYou think you know.\u201d \u201cWhat I think I know toggles, but it\u2019s started to settle. I want my own impressions tomorrow at the memorial. Either way, it\u2019s a stupid fucking murder.\u201d He poured two glasses, brought one to her. \u201cHave some wine. Pace about with it as you need to. I\u2019ll see to dinner.\u201d \u201cThere were vegetables in the pasta salad.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d He went into the kitchen, followed by the hopeful cat. Eve pushed up, and drank some wine. And paced about. \n Chapter Sixteen She kept pacing when he brought in plates. \u201cIt\u2019s mean.\u201d \u201cMurder?\u201d He set the plates on the table by the balcony doors. As they both enjoyed the air, he opened them before turning to her. \u201cIt is, yes.\u201d \u201cSure, but sometimes it\u2019s clean in a straightforward way, or crazy, impulsive, or purposeful. This is mean and stupid and personal.\u201d \u201cMurder offends you.\u201d Roarke brought the wine to the table. \u201cIt often makes you sad or angry\u2014or both. This one also annoys you.\u201d She frowned at her board. \u201cGuess it does.\u201d \u201cYou feel for the victim, always. You\u2019re their agent of justice.\u201d \u201cEve Dallas, Agent of Justice.\u201d On a half laugh, she rolled her eyes. \u201cIt has a ring. You feel for those left behind, always. And when you look at that board, you know one of those claiming that loss took her life.\u201d \u201cYeah, but that happens.\u201d Frustrated, and yes, annoyed, she shoved her hands in her pockets. \u201cIt happens more often than not.\u201d \u201cAnd all that you handle, day after day. But for this you see that mean stupidity, a friend killing a friend and bringing grief to so many others they claim as friends, so many others who were on the verge of celebrating that victim starting a new phase of her life.\u201d She did see it. She did feel it. And yeah, she admitted, it seriously annoyed. \u201cThat was the point, or part of it. Ending it before it began. When Casto came for me, in that same room at the same sort of deal, he didn\u2019t care about any of that. He just needed to end me because I was too close to exposing him. That makes sense. It\u2019s not stupid. It was logical.\u201d She gestured to the board with her wineglass. \u201cThis one cared about all of that.\u201d \u201cCome eat now. You\u2019re frustrating yourself.\u201d \u201cI probably am.\u201d She walked over, angled her head at the plates. Chicken glossy with sauce, a heap of fries, and the purple carrots she actually liked, mostly because purple. \u201cThat looks really good.\u201d She set down her wine, stepped over, and kissed him. \u201cThat\u2019s because I kicked Casto\u2019s ass that night so now we can sit here and eat what looks really good.\u201d She took her seat, snagged a fry. \u201cLooks aren\u2019t deceiving here. Frustrating myself some,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI liked it better when the dead artist\u2019s paintings\u2019 value seemed like a viable angle.\u201d \u201cBecause murder for monetary gain at least has some logic.\u201d \u201cYeah, it would still be mean and stupid and a little sloppy, but you could see the logic. But that\u2019s not it. Maybe, on some level, it adds a benefit because just about everyone on the board has at least one of her paintings. It\u2019s just not the reason.\u201d She sampled the chicken, found whatever coated it had an excellent tang. When Roarke topped off her wine, she decided that was fine. She was just circling anyway. Set it aside, she told herself. Let it circle, but set it aside. \u201cWhy were you downtown?\u201d \u201cA meeting at your Off Duty club.\u201d \u201cYou get a charge out of that, don\u2019t you? Saying it\u2019s my club.\u201d \u201cAs it is yours, and yes, I do. You already have tenants applying for Stone\u2019s apartment above.\u201d \u201cThat asshole. Do I?\u201d \u201cYou do. Once we do some vetting, you can choose.\u201d \u201cI can vet. I\u2019m a cop.\u201d \u201cThat you are.\u201d He smiled, a man who already knew the answer to the question. \u201cWould you like to?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely completely not.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be interviewing for managers, bartenders, kitchen and waitstaff, and so on in another couple of months. Would you like to take lead on that?\u201d \u201cStop it.\u201d Laughing, she went for a carrot. \u201cI\u2019m giving all that to you, like a present, because you like it.\u201d \u201cWhy, thank you, darling.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d As she ate, thunder rumbled in the distance. She remembered it had stormed the night of Erin Albright\u2019s murder. While the group had partied and danced and drank, the storm had rolled in, and rolled out again. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that security for the D&D.\u201d \u201cWe are. We should have a system up and running inside a week. You\u2019re wondering how different this would be if he\u2019d already had one.\u201d \u201cPeople find a way around them if they\u2019re smart enough, motivated enough. But yeah. He\u2019ll show at the memorial tomorrow, with Rochelle. It\u2019s personal to him, too.\u201d \u201cHis place.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s that. And he knew her. He liked her. People tended to like her,\u201d she added. \u201cHer across-the-hall neighbors liked her. She gave art lessons to one of their kids, wouldn\u2019t take payment. They had parties, but not loud and obnoxious. When you buy that building in your quest to own every inch of New York, add soundproofing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll make a note. You have a good picture of her.\u201d \u201cYeah, I do. I have a decent picture of all of them. Still, people have, like, undercurrents. I\u2019m looking at Mavis and her place, right? There she is, green hair\u2014and who knows what it\u2019ll be the next time I see her? That doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d She lifted her wine, drank. \u201cEven knowing she\u2019s going to pop out another kid doesn\u2019t surprise me. Her, well, road, shifted with Leonardo. That doesn\u2019t change basic Mavis, but it\u2026\u201d \u201cExpanded her.\u201d \u201cYeah, and literally when you consider Number Two. The color in those rooms, not a surprise. But the way it works, the way the whole place works, the gardening thing, Jesus, making lemonade from actual lemons, all that can still surprise me until I step back and realize all that was always there. She just didn\u2019t have the way, the means, the people to do it. \u201cShe\u2019s still Mavis, but that road shifted, and she\u2019s taking it.\u201d \u201cYou shifted mine.\u201d She looked back at him. \u201cGuess I did. That goes both ways. So we\u2019re sitting here, having dinner. The cat\u2019s across the room sleeping because you gave him some of that cat candy he likes. We got a breeze coming in because that and the thunder say a storm\u2019s coming. And a handful of years ago, I\u2019d never have pictured this. \u201cYou, either.\u201d \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t have a glimmer. Not until I picked up that gray button that came off your unfortunate suit and slipped it into my pocket. Even then, just a glimmer.\u201d \u201cYou sent me coffee, and maybe I had a glimmer. I just didn\u2019t get it. But here we are. Still, under it, through it, we are what we are. I\u2019m still a murder cop, you\u2019re still a gazillionaire.\u201d \u201cIt works for us, who we are.\u201d \u201cGood thing, or I wouldn\u2019t be eating these fries made from actual potatoes.\u201d She studied him as she ate one. \u201cDo you still have that button?\u201d He reached into his pocket, took it out. She shook her head; her heart simply soared. \u201cSap.\u201d \u201cIn this area,\u201d he said easily. \u201cBut smart enough to get through those initial and formidable defenses of yours with coffee.\u201d \u201cYeah, that was pretty damn smart.\u201d She ate a fry made from an actual potato as she studied that incredible face again. \u201cIf I\u2019d gone for somebody else, would you have killed me?\u201d Brows lifted, he picked up his wine. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a sharp turn.\u201d He looked over at her board. \u201cNo. I might have bought up the world\u2019s supply of coffee, then convinced you of your mistake. Or, alternately, found a way to \u2026 disqualify my rival.\u201d \u201cDisqualify?\u201d \u201cOne way or the other, short of murder,\u201d he added. \u201cYou being a murder cop would have discouraged me on that tactic. And you?\u201d \u201cMe? Oh, if you\u2019d lured me in with your seductive coffee, then dumped me? Murder cops know a lot of ways to kill without leaving a trace. But short of that? I\u2019d have just hounded you on your shady past until I got you tossed in a cage.\u201d She angled around to look at the board. \u201cSomebody on there didn\u2019t stop short.\u201d \u201cKilling the rival, or the one who rejected them?\u201d \u201cNot completely sure. But I know Lopez took the time to go into that shoe store to fuck with Shauna. I\u2019ve got no doubts she tried to put the moves on Erin within the last year. I\u2019d\u2019ve put some money on her for it.\u201d \u201cNow?\u201d \u201cHolding that bet because Barney had something besides what came out of the friggie and AC in that box. He was nervous, stayed nervous, and pushed for information on the case. Trying to size me up on it.\u201d She shifted back. \u201cHe took something, maybe just some little thing. And that\u2019s stupid, like the murder was stupid. He\u2019s got a thing for Shauna. It doesn\u2019t come off sexual, even romantic, but it\u2019s a thing.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re changing your bet.\u201d \u201cNot yet.\u201d She polished off the fries. \u201cNot yet, because either one of them could\u2019ve done it. And both of them wanted to.\u201d \u201cA partnership?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve played with that. May play some more, but it doesn\u2019t hold for me. It \u2026 wobbles,\u201d she decided. \u201cI can\u2019t see them hooking up, not for this, not for anything.\u201d Shrugging, she picked up her wine again, did a half toast. \u201cI\u2019ll know more tomorrow when I see them at the memorial.\u201d As she drank, lightning cracked the sky. Rain poured out. \u201cHere it comes,\u201d she said. Then she rose. \u201cI\u2019ve got the dishes.\u201d \u201cIs there anything I can do to help you? Runs? Finances?\u201d \u201cNot really, no.\u201d She walked to the window to watch the rain, to feel the whip of the wind. \u201cI need to write it up\u2014and I\u2019m going to copy Mira. Maybe writing it up will click something into place.\u201d When he joined her at the open doors, she leaned against him. Just two people, she thought, watching a storm blow its raging way over their city. \u201cI need to see them all together tomorrow. Together over death, how they react, how they interplay. I\u2019ve got some of their impressions of each other, a lot of the dynamics. I need to see how it all plays out.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cWhat have you got going?\u201d \u201cOh, a bit of this, a bit of that. I\u2019ll entertain myself well enough.\u201d \u201cHow about you give it an hour, then we entertain ourselves with a vid?\u201d Watching the storm, he stroked a hand down her hair. \u201cA vid, is it?\u201d \u201cIf something doesn\u2019t click, I\u2019m just going to keep circling.\u201d \u201cA vid works for me. So does an hour.\u201d She watched the storm another moment. \u201cA good thing I lost that button.\u201d \u201cAnd I intuited you could be won over by coffee.\u201d \u201cYeah. Anyway, I\u2019ve got the dishes.\u201d Though she didn\u2019t feel she made any progress or opened new avenues, Eve took the hour. They settled into their usual vid spot, the sofa in the bedroom. The action and complexity of the vid took her out of the investigation for a while. As did the slow, lazy sex that followed. She slept peacefully, curled between Roarke and the cat. Until she didn\u2019t. Back in the club, with Crack at the bar and the holo-band playing wild. Her friends, Erin Albright\u2019s friends, mixed and merged into one colorful, drunk, girl party. Why was she back here? Eve wondered. Nothing new here. She\u2019d stayed sober, she thought. Getting married tomorrow. \u201cI guess I should\u2019ve stayed sober, too.\u201d Beside her, Erin looked over the people, the color, the movement as Eve did. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t getting married until the weekend. And we were all having so much fun.\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known what was coming.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t know, either.\u201d \u201cYeah, true enough. But even if you\u2019d been cold sober, you\u2019re not trained. An ambush like that, from behind? You didn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d \u201cI love her so much.\u201d Tears gathered in Erin\u2019s eyes as she watched Shauna dance onstage. \u201cShe\u2019ll never go to Maui now. It\u2019s ruined for her. They killed me, sure. But they killed something in her, too.\u201d \u201cMight\u2019ve been the point.\u201d \u201cIf I had it to do over, I\u2019d know who to trust and who not to.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t, and you didn\u2019t. Why the hell am I back here?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t ask me. I\u2019m dead.\u201d Looking for something she missed? What the hell could she have missed in that small room? But she followed the dream, walked out of the club area, down the hallway, and turned into the privacy room. Casto jumped her, the syringe full of the drug Immortality in his hand. To protect himself, he\u2019d take her down. He\u2019d take her out. He managed to get a trace in her, but as she told him, she hadn\u2019t been drinking. She was getting married in the morning! He hurt her, blackened her eye, pounded her ribs, but that training, her determination to survive, met his head-on. And she took him down. A little woozy from that trace, she cuffed him. She started to stumble her way to the door. The wire went around her neck, biting into her skin. Blood trickled warm down her throat as she gasped for air. Unlike Erin, she didn\u2019t claw at the wire, but threw her body back against the attacker, added an elbow jab. For a second, just an instant, the wire loosened. But as it tightened again, she felt herself weaken. Pain, cutting pain. No air, her mind starting to slip into the gray. She thought of Roarke, waiting for her. Thought of the people in the club celebrating both of them. Thought of the life she\u2019d never know. Roarke pulled her up. \u201cYou wake up now. You wake up, damn it, and breathe. Eve, breathe!\u201d She sucked in air like a drowning woman, let it out with a shudder. Still on the edge of the dream, she lifted a hand to her throat. No wire cutting into her, no blood sliding down. \u201cJesus, Jesus, that was too fucking real.\u201d With his arms around her, with the cat butting his head against her hip, she dropped her head on Roarke\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m okay. It\u2019s okay. It was just so real.\u201d Galahad stopped butting his head against her and leaned heavy against her back. \u201cYou were choking. You didn\u2019t seem to breathe.\u201d He drew her back as he called for lights at ten percent. \u201cAh God, you\u2019re so pale.\u201d \u201cShook me up a little.\u201d More than a little, she thought as she struggled to even her breathing. She\u2019d felt the pain, she\u2019d felt the panic. \u201cThanks for pulling me out.\u201d She reached around, stroked a hand over the cat. \u201cYou, too. I was back at the D&D, then I went into the room, fought with Casto\u2014that prick. Had him down, had him cuffed. Then behind me, somebody, the garrote around my neck. I was dizzy and I was losing. I was dying.\u201d Eve wrapped around him in turn. \u201cBut there you were, pulling me back.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how long you were struggling to breathe. I\u2019d just walked in from a meeting. You\u2019re still shaking a bit.\u201d \u201cThat might be you.\u201d \u201cI might be at that. Sit a minute more. I\u2019ll get you coffee.\u201d She sat, watching him in the dim light. The sleek suit, the flow of his hair, the grace in his movements despite the shock. He programmed coffee for both of them, walked back, and handed her a mug. \u201cIt\u2019s nice being married,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it could work with us, didn\u2019t see how it could. But here we are, and it\u2019s nice being married.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re well stuck with me.\u201d \u201cBoth ways.\u201d She gulped down some coffee, felt alive again. \u201cReally sorry for the scare. I don\u2019t know what the hell that was about. Going back there doesn\u2019t do any good.\u201d \u201cYou lived; she didn\u2019t. You relate to her because of the circumstances.\u201d \u201cI guess I do. We\u2019re nothing alike, except for the circumstances. But dwelling on those parallels is stupid and unproductive.\u201d \u201cI disagree.\u201d He smoothed her hair, then laid a hand on her cheek as color came back into it. \u201cIt helps you see her, and you need to see the victim.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s screwing with my objectivity. It puts a shadow over it.\u201d \u201cIf you didn\u2019t use those shadows, Lieutenant, you wouldn\u2019t be the cop you are. But Christ knows there are times I wish it didn\u2019t get inside you as it does.\u201d Then he sighed. \u201cAnd yet that\u2019s what makes you who you are. So I\u2019m well stuck as well, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cLooks that way to me. What the hell time is it?\u201d \u201cIt was half-five when I finished the meeting, so just shy of six.\u201d \u201cOkay, all right. Boy, am I awake, so I\u2019m going to grab a workout, smooth myself out some.\u201d \u201cYou should try this new program, an urban obstacle course. Program New York Challenge. It earned the title.\u201d He cupped her cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if you\u2019re up to it.\u201d She decided it sounded perfect. The program proved it earned the title, and she proved she was up to it. Inside of three minutes she broke a sweat as she ran, climbed, belayed, tunnel crawled, dodged, jumped, and swung her way through Midtown. She capped that off with ten laps in the pool, and felt normal again as she rode back upstairs. In the bedroom, Roarke and the cat sat on the sofa. The screen scrolled with stock reports. And all was right in her personal world. \u201cYou were right about the program\u2014it\u2019s a killer. I was up to it.\u201d \u201cYou look yourself again,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt pumped me up.\u201d She programmed coffee, took it with her to shower. When she came out, he had two domed plates on the table. Galahad sulked on the foot of the bed. Roarke smiled at her as he removed the domes. \u201cIt seemed like a pancake kind of day.\u201d Pampering her, she thought, when she\u2019d scared them both. \u201cIt should always be a pancake kind of day.\u201d \u201cYou have the memorial later.\u201d \u201cYeah, and you\u2019re fortifying me, but not with spinach. They\u2019re not cakes,\u201d she said as she sat beside him. \u201cAnd don\u2019t they make them on a griddle sort of thing? But they call them pancakes anyway.\u201d She drowned them in syrup. And after the first bite, didn\u2019t care what the hell they called them. She called them good. \u201cWhat did you give the cat for helping pull me back?\u201d \u201cHe enjoyed some smoked tuna for breakfast.\u201d \u201cAnd still he\u2019s pissed because he\u2019s not getting pancakes, too.\u201d She took another bite. \u201cIt is nice to be married. It\u2019s stupid for me to keep thinking Erin Albright didn\u2019t get the chance to find out if it would\u2019ve been nice for her.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not stupid.\u201d Touched, Roarke kissed her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s compassionate, and how does that compassion interfere with your cop brain? Not a bit, darling Eve. Not at all.\u201d \u201cMaybe not.\u201d \u201cYou have to know your victim. It\u2019s always how it works for you. Know the victim, find the killer. It\u2019s fascinating to me. Endlessly.\u201d \u201cMaybe. Maybe. They made stupid, rookie mistakes. They shouldn\u2019t have brought the case in\u2014or if that was cover in the event they got spotted, they should\u2019ve taken it with them when they left. \u201cLuck,\u201d Eve continued, \u201cpure idiot luck they didn\u2019t get spotted, that they got in and out without being seen. And they stage a half-assed robbery. Stupid. But they had to take her \u2019link. There had to be communications on there. If I had enough, I could get a warrant for the suspects\u2019 e\u2019s. But I don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThe unregistered could deal with that easily enough,\u201d he reminded her. Frowning, she drank more coffee. \u201cIf I felt there was any chance another life was in danger, I\u2019d be tempted there. But I don\u2019t. The job\u2019s done. Erin was the target. Shauna\u2019s hurt is either a by-product or an added benefit. But there\u2019s nothing to indicate anyone else is in danger.\u201d \u201cIf you change your mind, it\u2019s available.\u201d She polished off the pancakes, rose. \u201cI\u2019m going to a memorial. I\u2019m wearing black.\u201d \u201cUnderstood.\u201d \u201cJust wanted to get that out of the way.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bit of a break with the heat, but you might want to go with linen.\u201d She made some noncommittal sound as she went into her closet. She wasn\u2019t always a hundred percent sure which was linen. Black tee, black jacket, black trousers and boots, belt. Easy as it got, she decided. And if the jacket and trousers weren\u2019t linen, they were lightweight. She came out for her weapon harness. \u201cI like color,\u201d she began. \u201cI do like color, but if they\u2019d never invented it, getting dressed in the morning would be a hell of a lot easier. Creepy,\u201d she realized as she strapped her weapon on. \u201cIt would probably be creepy, and make it harder to identify a fleeing suspect.\u201d \u201cBoring, and creepy. That said, you look respectful and formidable in your full black.\u201d \u201cI want to intimidate the hell out of my top two suspects.\u201d \u201cMy money\u2019s on you, always.\u201d Rising, he walked to her, kissed her. \u201cTake care of my formidable cop.\u201d \u201cPlan to.\u201d She kissed him again, added a quick, hard hug. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s nice being married. See you later.\u201d She started out. And it flashed into her brain, just leaped inside and stuck. She turned around and went back. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a mistake. It wasn\u2019t a goddamn mistake. It was deliberate.\u201d \u201cThe case?\u201d God, it was amazing to have someone who got her, who got it. \u201cThe case, yeah, the frigging case, and what was in it. Not a mistake to leave it there, a deliberate shot. At Shauna. The big dream, forever ruined. Her dream, and one Erin wanted to give her, was going to give her.\u201d Eve started to pace. \u201cThe killer doesn\u2019t have to take the case, the tickets, the costume, those pink shoes to the D&D, but they do. Okay, maybe cover\u2014that\u2019s a benefit. \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a surprise. Shh.\u2019 But they left them for a purpose. \u201cTo destroy the dream.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s damn right\u2014not stupid after all. Mean, vindictive, and purposeful.\u201d Behind them, a dome crashed to the floor. Roarke turned to see the cat busily licking syrup from a plate. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d \u201cKnock it off,\u201d Eve snapped. \u201cDown. Now!\u201d When the cat leaped down, slunk away, Roarke snarled. \u201cNow I\u2019m insulted. That fecking cat. That\u2019s insulting he cowers off when you tell him to.\u201d \u201cNever mind that. It\u2019s a twofer. Erin\u2019s dead, but Shauna not only loses her, she loses this dream she\u2019s had. Not only loses it, but knows she was just this close to having it. Now it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s all gone. It was fucking deliberate, Roarke. I didn\u2019t see it was on purpose.\u201d \u201cYou do now, don\u2019t you? And I say you\u2019re right on it. It makes a miserable sort of sense, doesn\u2019t it then? Punish them both.\u201d \u201cNot a mistake,\u201d Eve said again, \u201cso smarter than I gave them credit for initially. The half-assed robbery? No real choice. Have to ditch the \u2019link. Something on there that relates, so have to get it gone\u2014and the rest is window dressing.\u201d On her next pass, she scooped up the dome, tossed it back on the table. \u201cA first kill\u2014I\u2019m sure of that, the first kill. But not as stupid as I figured. Impulse maybe\u2014opportunity knocked, but always planned out. Always with the purpose of taking a slap at Shauna along with it. She had to pay, too.\u201d \u201cDoes it tell you who? As, not being a cop, I don\u2019t see.\u201d \u201cI am a cop, and I\u2019m not sure. It works for both Lopez and Barney. In a twisted, selfish, bitchy way. But it changes things up a little. Looks like that dream wasn\u2019t a waste of time after all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d so much rather you come to these conclusions without scaring the life out of me.\u201d She stepped to him, kissed him one more time. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do going forward. The cat made a mess out of the table. See you later.\u201d \u201cGood hunting,\u201d Roarke said, and looked back at the table. She wasn\u2019t wrong there, he noted. \u201cBugger it,\u201d he decided. He\u2019d apologize to Summerset later. \n Chapter Seventeen She let it roll and circle and backtrack as she drove downtown. It mattered, she thought. Not only because every detail mattered, but because\u2014if she\u2019d hit it right\u2014it widened the motive. Still a stupid murder, but not as stupid if it accomplished two for one. Take a life, destroy a dream. For Lopez, take the life of the one who rejected you and destroy the dream of the one she chose instead. For Barney, take the life of the one who\u2014even years later\u2014replaced you, and destroy the dream of the one who moved on from you. It felt stronger with Lopez, she decided\u2014and it had been a downright mean murder: the time, the place. But Barney had put something in that damn box. Nerves, a trace of guilt. She wasn\u2019t wrong there. Erin could have given the swipe and the case to either of them. The killer came in the back, almost certainly. Nothing to stop Lopez from sliding in back there, putting the case in the room, then joining the party. In fact, wouldn\u2019t that be exactly what Erin would\u2019ve requested? And nothing to stop Barney\u2014except the risk of being seen\u2014from using the swipe, going in, waiting. She could see it both ways, and found that incredibly irritating. When she pulled into Central, she considered tagging Mira. Not yet, she decided, no point yet. Speculation, and lots of it, but not yet. She\u2019d wait until she got a better feel at the memorial. The elevator hadn\u2019t cleared the garage levels when the doors opened. Two uniforms who didn\u2019t look old enough for a legal drink walked an obviously jonesing junkie inside. He had wild red hair, wilder blue eyes and smelled like a dumpster that hadn\u2019t been unloaded in a week, then had its contents pissed on by a group of drunks. \u201cOh, come on, man\u201d was all Eve could think of. \u201cSorry, Lieutenant.\u201d The wild blue eyes wheeled at Eve. \u201cI\u2019m the captain. I outrank you. I\u2019m the captain. I just need a taste. Just gimme a taste!\u201d As he wailed it, the second cop sighed. \u201cJust settle down, Jack. Stronger than he looks. He tried to throw some schmuck through the window of a twenty-four/seven.\u201d When the door opened again, Eve started to step out\u2014away from the smell. Jack the junkie wrenched away from the uniforms and launched himself at Eve like a cannonball. \u201cI\u2019m the captain!\u201d He screamed it as they both flew through the elevator doors. Her hip struck the floor hard enough to sing, but she rolled clear. With his hands cuffed, Jack just slid, face and body. When he tried to scramble up, Eve simply stuck out a leg, tripped him, and sent him sliding again. \u201cSorry! Sorry, Lieutenant!\u201d The uniforms grabbed him from both sides, hauled him up. \u201cJesus Christ, Officers! Maintain control of your prisoner.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s slippery. I mean literally, sir. Greased-pig slippery. Do you need medical?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need frigging medical. Maybe the fume tube, but not medical.\u201d As Jack began to shake, sob, laugh, she decided a dressing-down, deserved, would only delay the process. \u201cHe needs medical and the tank. Get medical to meet you at Processing, for God\u2019s sake. His system\u2019s wrecked, he needs Psych, and now his nose is bleeding. In your charge,\u201d she snapped, and made her way to the glides. How the hell did two rookies get tossed out on the street together? she wondered. They damn sure needed a trainer. She sniffed at her shirt, just in case that brief contact had contaminated her clothes. Seemed clear enough. By the time she made it to Homicide, she was more than ready for another damn coffee. She walked in to see Jenkinson wearing the same mouse tie as the day before. \u201cWhat, you got two of them?\u201d \u201cHuh? Hey, morning, boss. Reineke\u2019s hitting the break room for coffee. We got his ass. The best friend. Fucker killed his friend, for nothing.\u201d The cold case, she remembered. The trip to Boston she\u2019d authorized. \u201cGot him as in he\u2019s in a cage?\u201d \u201cOh yeah. Boston gave us the lever, Dallas. Once we got a face-to-face sit-down with the widow, she opened up about some of the inconsistences in the bastard\u2019s statements. How she didn\u2019t think of all that when it happened, but later.\u201d Reineke came out of the break room with two mugs of cop coffee. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d do anything to hurt her husband, them being such good pals and all.\u201d Reineke picked up the report, handed Jenkinson a mug. \u201cHow broken up he\u2019d been.\u201d \u201cHow he\u2019d been there for her,\u201d Jenkinson continued. \u201cHelped her plan the memorial. How he\u2019d come up with flowers to try to cheer her up.\u201d \u201cHow they\u2019d sit and talk for hours about the dead guy, and cry on each other\u2019s shoulder.\u201d Sipping coffee, Reineke sat on the corner of his partner\u2019s desk. \u201cAnd he never made a move on her, just comforted, supported.\u201d \u201cAdd she felt guilty because they\u2019d had a fight,\u201d Eve assumed. \u201cOh yeah. He\u2019d say how the dead guy loved her, and knew she loved him. Married people have fights.\u201d Jenkinson gestured with his mug. \u201cWove in there how he felt so sorry he\u2019d let the dead guy walk home when he\u2019d had so much to drink. How he\u2019d live the rest of his life wishing he\u2019d talked him into staying the night.\u201d \u201cThen she\u2019d automatically tell him how it wasn\u2019t his fault.\u201d Jenkinson nodded at Eve. \u201cGot that in one. He gives it some time, then he takes her out\u2014just friends. She\u2019s got the money, and the society rung, so it\u2019s fancy parties and the gala shit.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s \u2018Oh, you don\u2019t have to, no, you shouldn\u2019t,\u2019 when she insists on buying him a tux and shit like that.\u201d Reineke shook his head. \u201cPlaying the long game. Takes his time, rakes some fancy stuff in before he makes any move on her.\u201d \u201cShe falls for it,\u201d Jenkinson said. \u201cShe\u2019s ripe for it, and he sweet-talks her, romances her, though she\u2019s paying the freight. Even after she marries him, everything stays nice and sweet awhile.\u201d \u201cThen he starts pushing for more,\u201d Reineke added. \u201cMore trips, a boat, buys himself big-dollar crap with her money, and gets pissy when she draws some lines.\u201d \u201cHe starts making mistakes.\u201d Jenkinson looked at his partner. \u201cThey always do. Saying the wrong thing if they\u2019re arguing. Like how miserable she made the dead guy, how he wanted a divorce. And the kicker?\u201d \u201cHow the night it happened, dead guy wanted to stay with the best friend, but friend made him go home to his bitchy wife.\u201d \u201cInconsistencies,\u201d Eve concluded. \u201cShe starts thinking about that, and how the dead guy used to say best pal used to whine about money, how his good friend had more than he needed. How he\u2019d made some loans the pal never paid back.\u201d \u201c\u2018You got that rich wife in your pocket.\u2019\u201d Reineke nodded. \u201cShe remembered her dead husband telling her the friend said shit like that. How he\u2019d know how to live, and how to help out his pals if he had a rich wife.\u201d \u201cBloom went off the rose.\u201d Jenkinson fluttered his mouse tie. \u201cTook awhile, but that rose lost its bloom. Best pal, talking trash about the dead guy, drawing out money until she blocked him off her portfolio.\u201d \u201cShe said he started to scare her, so she filed for divorce and, the house being hers, locked him out.\u201d \u201cHe got back in,\u201d Jenkinson said. \u201cKnew the security, how to get around it, since he\u2019d installed. And that made her start thinking. Thinking hard enough she had the security switched out, closed up the house, and moved her ass to Boston. She\u2019s got people there.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t go to the cops with the inconsistencies, this feeling she had?\u201d \u201cNope, LT, she didn\u2019t.\u201d Jenkinson shrugged. \u201cShe told us she couldn\u2019t make herself really believe he\u2019d do something like that. Accepted he\u2019d married her for her money, but couldn\u2019t swallow he\u2019d kill, not all-the-way-down swallow.\u201d \u201cAfter we had a talk with her, we had a talk with him, let him know we\u2019d reopened the investigation, and were doing interviews again.\u201d \u201cThat fucker\u2019s face.\u201d With a broad smile, Jenkinson shook his head. \u201cIt was all right there on his face. He\u2019d gotten away with it. He\u2019d gotten what he wanted and never paid nothing. But now here we come sniffing.\u201d \u201cAnd he started sweating. Got his story mixed up\u2014claimed, hell, who could remember. But he kept tripping up. So we brought him down here. Formal interview. Took us awhile.\u201d \u201cTook us awhile, but we got him. Guilt was eating at him some maybe or we stirred it up enough to make him break.\u201d \u201cOr we\u2019re just damn good at what we do.\u201d Reineke grinned, slapped high fives. \u201cWe are that. We got him, eighteen years later, but we got him.\u201d \u201cGood work. Have you notified the widow?\u201d \u201cGoing to wait until like after nine. Like civilized,\u201d Jenkinson said. \u201cI think she knows. Damn clear she divorced him because she worried or wondered. Then when we showed up at the door, she knew.\u201d \u201cClose it off. Good work,\u201d she repeated, then turned to her office as Peabody came in, pink boots clomping. She had her hair in a high-flippy tail. Eve decided it could be worse. Those streaks in it could be pink instead of red. Obviously, she\u2019d considered the memorial, and had gone with black pants and jacket even if the shirt was a pale blue. \u201cMorning, all.\u201d \u201cMy office,\u201d Eve said, and headed for it. \u201cSure. Let me just stow my stuff.\u201d After Peabody pushed her bag into a desk drawer, she trotted after Eve. \u201cDid something break?\u201d \u201cNo, no break.\u201d Eve programmed two coffees\u2014one black, one regular\u2014as she studied the board once more. \u201cJust a shift in motive, maybe. One that clicks for me.\u201d Over coffee, she laid it out for Peabody. \u201cI can see it. Easier to fix Lopez in that box than Barney. She\u2019d have no trouble destroying Shauna\u2019s dream trip, her wedding, or anything else. Harder for me to see Barney. Long friendship, partnered up with her best friend.\u201d \u201cJenkinson and Reineke just closed a cold case. Murder by best friend. He wanted a shot at the wife, and eventually got it. Couldn\u2019t keep her though. Guy bashed his friend\u2019s head in hoping he could hook up with the guy\u2019s wife\u2014and her money. Maybe Barney wants to hook up with Shauna again.\u201d Peabody frowned. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s even\u2014carefully\u2014suggested it, or made a little move.\u201d \u201cNow you\u2019re following. Tested the waters, perhaps. That\u2019s a hard no, and you have the rejection angle right there again.\u201d \u201cOkay, with that, I can see either one of them. Which one? You usually know, or at least have a strong sense once we get to this point.\u201d \u201cIf I bet on the job?\u201d Eve tapped an ID shot. \u201cReally? Damn it, I was betting on Lopez.\u201d \u201cAlso a viable bet.\u201d \u201cThen why Barney over her?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t see his face,\u201d Eve murmured. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see his face when he came out of the apartment carrying that box. I\u2019d probably go with Lopez if I hadn\u2019t seen his face.\u201d Eve moved to her skinny window, stared outside. \u201cShe says she doesn\u2019t want to go back there, and if he takes her at her word, maybe he takes something he wants.\u201d \u201cIf it was valuable\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, nothing of value. Sentiment, more likely. Something Shauna won\u2019t think about asking for. Or if she does, they can\u2019t find it. Just a little something. Because she\u2019s his. His ex-girlfriend, his friend, his to hover over, to walk home from work. His.\u201d \u201cOkay. You\u2019re convincing me.\u201d Eve shook her head. \u201cI could make pretty much the same case with Lopez. We\u2019re going to get Shauna\u2019s permission to go through the apartment again this morning before we go to the memorial. Maybe we\u2019ll see\u2014or not see\u2014what he took out in that box.\u201d \u201cAnything I can dig into until?\u201d \u201cJust take another pass through both of their data. I\u2019m going to do the same. A first kill,\u201d Eve muttered. \u201cIt looks and feels like a first kill. And it looks and feels to me like the wedding\u2014only days away\u2014was the real trigger, with the honeymoon deal cementing time and place, and the willingness to risk exposure.\u201d She paused by the board again. \u201cWe need to have another conversation with Becca. Just like with the cold case Jenkinson and Reineke just closed, she might have seen, heard, sensed something, but dismissed it. She wouldn\u2019t believe the guy she\u2019s in love with could or would kill.\u201d \u201cAnd for what?\u201d Peabody added. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the what once we get the who.\u201d Eve sat back at her desk to pore through what she\u2019d already pored through multiple times. But she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling, or maybe just the hope, that something in that background data would bring a spark. Lopez, a woman born in privilege thanks to the hard work and enterprise of those who\u2019d come before her. Still, her work ethic stayed strong. Her choice of career put her, and her body, in the spotlight. She didn\u2019t strip for the money, to pay the bills, to put food on the table. She stripped for style, for the attention, and because she was good at it. But the money wasn\u2019t nothing. A relatively diverse family, though the majority married within their culture of origin. Those who hadn\u2019t appeared to enjoy the same tight family and financial ties. A sprinkle of same-sex marriages over the decades, also by all indications accepted. A very large family, so it didn\u2019t surprise her to see a handful of criminal bumps, a few relations who\u2019d done some time\u2014either in prison or in rehab. Nothing that stuck out to her, let her see some pattern. A well-off woman closing in on thirty who\u2019d had no legal cohabs, no marriages, no offspring. One who worked diligently at her chosen profession. And had a mean streak. \u201cLeave out the well-off and that could describe me a few years ago.\u201d She sat back, added a big, tight, supportive family as another difference. A planner, Eve thought. She\u2019d have to be to select costumes, work out choreography, handle her part of the real estate arm. Passionate\u2014a temper, the mean streak, the use of sex as either revenge or solace. Add the ego, the bitchiness. \u201cYou fit, Lopez. You slide in smooth enough.\u201d She toggled over to Barney, and thought the same thing as she reexamined his background. Not as privileged financially, not as big a family, but a good-looking white male, just shy of thirty. That brought a built-in sense of privilege. A better-than-average student, part-time work during the school summers and breaks. Responsible. Football quarterback, team captain, lettered in high school there. And of course, stood as the male half of Shaunbar. Two sisters, younger, parents that had each been married once, and stayed married for thirty-one years and counting. Two uncles on the paternal side, one aunt on the maternal, and a total of six cousins. No, not as tight, Eve thought, as the family had scattered in the last couple of generations. One same-sex marriage and one divorce, one charge of simple assault among the cousins. None currently lived in New York. Since he\u2019d majored in business management, had taken leadership courses, she assumed he\u2019d reached his career goal. No marriages, the single\u2014and current\u2014cohab, no offspring. Another planner\u2014couldn\u2019t manage and lead successfully otherwise. Passionate enough to make captain of the team, pursue a singular career goal and achieve it. Ego, yeah. Mean streak? None that showed. She glanced at the board, at his good-looking, all-American face. \u201cI\u2019m betting you just hide it better than Lopez. She doesn\u2019t give a shit who sees hers. You would.\u201d Enough, she thought, and closed the files, enough circling. She contacted Shauna. \u201cLieutenant, did you find them?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have any information for you at this time. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d When Eve looked at her, she saw what she often thought of as survivor\u2019s exhaustion. \u201cI keep hoping\u2026\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re actively investigating, I promise you. I know this is a hard day, and I\u2019m sorry to intrude on it. Detective Peabody and I would like your permission to go through your apartment again.\u201d \u201cThe apartment?\u201d With dull blue eyes, Shauna just stared. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d like to take one more look, to be absolutely thorough.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t been back. I\u2019m not going to, but Becca brought some of my things. Clothes and things. Um, Greg cleared out the food we had so it wouldn\u2019t spoil. Erin\u2019s family \u2026 they\u2019re going to get her things after today. After the memorial. Angie and Donna are going to help them.\u201d She passed a hand over her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done without them the last few days. Or Becca, Greg, Marcus. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I will do.\u201d \u201cI hope you\u2019ll arrange for the grief counseling.\u201d \u201cI need to get through today. You can go in the apartment. I don\u2019t care about the apartment.\u201d \u201cAll right, we\u2019ll go through this morning before the memorial. We\u2019d like to come to pay our respects.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s kind of you. Greg says I should take a soother before, but I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m saying I did so he stops worrying, but I won\u2019t. I need to feel it, all of it.\u201d You will, Eve thought after she clicked off. You\u2019ll feel it all. To take just another minute, she got coffee, stood at her window. It wouldn\u2019t help Shauna, not today, to know how many other people out there felt that exhaustion, felt that grief, felt it all. Taking a soother (hovering?) wasn\u2019t bad advice, but she understood the need to feel it all. She felt it now, let herself feel it, because it helped push her to do the job she\u2019d sworn to do. She couldn\u2019t protect Erin Albright\u2014it was too late for that. But she could and would serve her. She walked out into the bullpen, saw all her detectives at their desks, all doing the work. Eventually they\u2019d be called out into the field, to another scene, another body. And they\u2019d serve the dead, as always. \u201cPeabody, with me.\u201d \u201cShauna\u2019s first?\u201d Peabody asked when she caught up. \u201cYeah. She knew Barney cleaned out the food, so that wasn\u2019t on the sly. Erin\u2019s family is getting her things out after the memorial. Angie and Donna are helping them. Barney\u2019s pushing Shauna to take a soother before the memorial. She\u2019s going to tell him she did so he lays off.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re leaning toward him again, and damn it, I\u2019m nearly all in on Lopez.\u201d \u201cYou first.\u201d \u201cOkay. Some of it\u2019s personality. She\u2019s got a hard edge to her, and she gets what she wants. She works for it, but she gets it. She\u2019s used to getting it, and being the one who says yes or no. Erin said no to her. And if she has\u2014or had\u2014real feelings for Erin, say more than just sex, but feelings, how would she handle that?\u201d \u201cAll right, decent question, decent point.\u201d \u201cWhen it\u2019s just sex, it\u2019s easier to move on, right?\u201d \u201cHow good is the sex?\u201d one of the cops who\u2019d shuffled on wanted to know. \u201cAlso a decent question, decent point. I\u2019m going to surmise, pretty damn good.\u201d \u201cNot a snap to move on from pretty damn good sex. And you start thinking it was better than maybe it was anyway. Ask me about my ex-wife.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Eve told him. \u201cYou can keep that one to yourself.\u201d \u201cI still say it\u2019s easier to move on from just sex than sex with an emotional element mixed in,\u201d Peabody insisted. \u201cEspecially if you don\u2019t usually feel, maybe never feel, that emotional element.\u201d \u201cI had that element.\u201d The cop, a grizzled detective with tired eyes, shook his head. \u201cStarted out one way, then hit the other end of that scale at the end. You get pushed to move on, it pisses you off.\u201d \u201cThat.\u201d Peabody pointed at him. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Erin forced Lopez to move on, and those feelings took that dive. So she killed her, and set it up to screw over Shauna\u2019s big dream.\u201d \u201cA reasonable scenario,\u201d Eve agreed, and when the doors opened to let their elevator companion off, she asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill your ex-wife, did you?\u201d \u201cNah. Had a kid who\u2019d\u2019ve been pretty pissed off at me if I had. Me, I just imagine her miserable, and that keeps a spring in my step.\u201d \u201cJust because he didn\u2019t,\u201d Peabody began, and Eve waved her off. \u201cI get it, Peabody, and it\u2019s a solid rundown. I think you\u2019re right about the feelings. Genuine or not, who knows, but definitely feelings there.\u201d \u201cBut you still lean toward Barney?\u201d Eve stepped out into the garage. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the Mr. All-Americans. Straight, white, male. Closing in on thirty, good-looking, solid job, sharp dresser. He\u2019s also pretty much gotten what he wants. The popular boy in high school and part of the shining couple. Quarterback\u2014calls the plays. Team captain, and all that. Two siblings, younger sisters. So he\u2019s\u2014potentially\u2014the prince growing up.\u201d She got in the car. \u201cLike Lopez, he works, and like Lopez, works at a career of his choosing. His parents remain married to each other, live in a house in the burbs\u2014the same house where he grew up. The same district where he, Shauna, Becca\u2014and his younger siblings\u2014all went to school.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand how that applies.\u201d \u201cFirst, he\u2019s a big brother. Maybe he takes that role too seriously. Second, he\u2019s a big brother in what reads like a very traditional family. He had\u2014they call it a career, right?\u2014an upscale sort of high school career. He was a kind of star\u2014Becca said royalty. She said Shauna\u2014and think Shaunbar\u2014was high school royalty. \u201cAnd he did just fine in college\u2014not royalty, but he did fine.\u201d As she drove, she visualized it. \u201cMoves back\u2014home first\u2014works at a men\u2019s shop in a local, upscale again, shopping area. Then he moved into the city. But when I took a look at both, guess who moved to the city first?\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Peabody pursed her lips. \u201cShauna?\u201d \u201cYeah, like about three months before him. And he not only moves to the city, gets a job in the men\u2019s shop where he manages now, but moves into the same building as Shauna.\u201d \u201cThe same building?\u201d \u201cAt that time, yeah.\u201d \u201cI missed that. It\u2019s a pisser to have missed that.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if either of us missed it before, or just didn\u2019t look at that timing. Becca was already in the city\u2014zipped straight into her job after college. She was around the corner at the time, and she and Shauna reconnected. Then the three of them reconnected. Shauna\u2019s dating someone else\u2014and Barney hooks up with Becca.\u201d \u201cBut you think he moved to the city, and where in the city, because of Shauna.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s possible. And now, what? She\u2019s dating another woman? She\u2019s engaged? She\u2019s getting freaking married?\u201d \u201cAn ego thing? Like what\u2019s wrong with my penis?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a solid point. That wasn\u2019t a damn pun.\u201d \u201cIt would be a good one.\u201d Eve pulled into the now familiar loading zone, flipped on her On Duty light. \u201cSo his ego, led by his penis, decides Erin has to go,\u201d Eve continued. \u201cOr his big brother deal demands he has to go to save Shauna from making a mistake. A combination of both would work.\u201d She considered as they hiked to the apartment building. \u201cIt\u2019s something to bounce off Mira. Both yours, and mine.\u201d \u201cBut you think it\u2019s him.\u201d \u201cAt this point, Peabody, it\u2019s a gut thing. It\u2019s the deli meat\u2014\u2018Let me make you a sandwich,\u2019 and Becca\u2019s casual \u2018Stop hovering.\u2019 Like he tends to do that. It\u2019s the walking home with her from work, and it\u2019s the timing when he moved here and where he moved.\u201d At the building, she took out her master. \u201cAnd topping all of that? His face when he saw me in the hall. The way he shifted the box, the way he tried to pump me for info and kept tossing out the lowlife theory. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t like the way he talked about Crack\u2019s place. Personal maybe, but I didn\u2019t like that, or how it slid just over the edge of victim shaming.\u201d Inside, they hiked up the stairs. \u201cNo proof,\u201d she added. \u201cNothing to hang that on but my gut. Nothing to hang it on Lopez but logic. We need enough to get one or both of them in the box. Just enough for that. It\u2019s a first kill, and if a kill can be planned and impulsive at once, this one was. \u201cWe\u2019d break him\u2014or her. Killing\u2019s not who they are. Controlling is.\u201d \u201cYeah, controlling,\u201d Peabody agreed. \u201cBoth of them. You\u2019re right on that. Maybe benign in Barney\u2019s case, but it\u2019s still a controlling nature.\u201d \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have left the case,\u201d Eve said as they came out on the fourth floor. \u201cWhichever of them did it, they shouldn\u2019t have left the case, should\u2019ve resisted the need to add pain onto pain for Shauna. We\u2019d have almost nothing without that.\u201d \u201cI wish we had more than we do.\u201d \u201cHope can suck you dry. Work instead. We won\u2019t be able to tell what Barney took\u2014but we\u2019ll go through and see if anything strikes.\u201d She mastered in. After a quick scan of the living area, she gestured left, then to the side. \u201cPhotos gone, there and there. Of the two of them.\u201d \u201cShe might\u2019ve wanted those. I\u2019d want those.\u201d \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll see if we can find out. Art\u2019s still up.\u201d She walked into the kitchen, checked the friggie. Not only empty, but spotless. Not a single spill in sight. \u201cAC\u2019s empty, too,\u201d Peabody said after a check. They walked out. Peabody took the bedroom, Eve the office/studio. \u201cThe wedding dresses\u2014they\u2019re gone.\u201d \u201cYeah, some of Shauna\u2019s shoes from in there.\u201d \u201cSame with the dresser, Dallas. Some of Shauna\u2019s stuff. It\u2019s the size, the style makes it easy to see what\u2019s hers, what was Erin\u2019s.\u201d Eve moved in to the bedroom. \u201cThere was another photo on the dresser\u2014one of those e-frames that holds a bunch of photos and scrolls them when you want.\u201d \u201cSome of the jewelry\u2019s gone,\u201d Peabody told her. \u201cI\u2019m going to say Shauna\u2019s again\u2014it\u2019s the style. Erin\u2019s stuff is more\u2014I guess bold. Artistic.\u201d Peabody moved into the bathroom. \u201cBasic supplies missing. Hair, skin stuff, some makeup, OTC meds, like that.\u201d \u201cOkay. Okay. We\u2019ve seen what we can see. I want to go by the gallery, speak to Frost, then we\u2019ll go to the memorial.\u201d \u201cFrost?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll know what\u2019s happening with the art. Let\u2019s find out.\u201d \n Chapter Eighteen Glenda had just opened the gallery when they walked in. Eve supposed she\u2019d dressed for the memorial\u2014or for work\u2014which involved a slim back dress. She stood with a man\u2014early thirties, black suit, burnished blond hair in a small topknot\u2014and held up a finger to Eve as a signal to give her a minute. \u201cEssie will prepare the Stenner watercolor for transport. Ms. Eglin\u2019s sending a messenger to pick it up around noon. Just make sure everything\u2019s ready. If Dale Wisebrenner brings in the bronze I approved after I leave, I want it placed in the south gallery.\u201d \u201cGlenda, you told me. We\u2019ve got it. And I know to contact Mr. Gibbets about the pottery, and tag Wilfred if he doesn\u2019t show up by one. Don\u2019t worry, please don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ve got enough on your mind.\u201d \u201cNagging you helps take my mind off what\u2019s on it.\u201d She gave his arm a squeeze as she spoke. \u201cGive me a second.\u201d As she crossed to Eve and Peabody, the man discreetly moved through an alcove to give them the space. \u201cI hate memorials,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone actually enjoys them, but I just hate them. Add I\u2019m barely back from vacation and taking most of the day off. I\u2019m dumping a lot on our team. Which is an excuse,\u201d she added, \u201cnot to think about how much I hate going to Erin\u2019s memorial. She\u2019s too young to be memorialized. She should\u2019ve had decades more.\u201d She brushed a hand over her perfectly styled hair. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m rambling. How can I help you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m curious whether there are any plans for Erin\u2019s art. You mentioned you hoped to have a posthumous showing.\u201d \u201cYes. Actually, Erin\u2019s mother contacted me yesterday. It seems the family, and Shauna, talked it over. They\u2019re going to choose some of Erin\u2019s paintings for themselves. They\u2019d asked if I\u2019d be willing to hold a showing in the fall. They want to start a scholarship in Erin\u2019s name for art students.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cDamn it. It gets to me. It\u2019s a generous idea, and Erin would love it. No question. I want to put together a proposal for the owners. They\u2019re in Florence at the moment. I want to waive or at least greatly reduce our percentage.\u201d \u201cSo all her paintings\u2014other than what she sold or gave as gifts, and whatever her family and Shauna want to keep.\u201d \u201cExactly. None of them want to profit, and instead want to create something meaningful. She has a lot of work stored at the studio.\u201d \u201cYeah, we saw it. Since they\u2019re planning this, there\u2019s a piece I\u2019d like to pre-buy or bid on\u2014whatever it is.\u201d \u201cOh?\u201d \u201cPizza parlor, interior. A lot of color and movement, and a lone figure sitting at the window counter.\u201d \u201cYes, I know the piece. It\u2019s good. Not her best, if you want my opinion\u2014which was also hers. But it\u2019s good. Can I ask why you want it?\u201d \u201cThe place has a personal meaning for me.\u201d Glenda smiled a little. \u201cWhich means I could double its price, but won\u2019t. In any case, if you find who killed Erin, they\u2019ll want to gift it to you.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t accept that. Not how it\u2019s done.\u201d \u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll speak to them. Personal meanings matter.\u201d Glenda looked over toward the portrait of the old woman. \u201cIt\u2019s all personal now.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019ll price the paintings you exhibit and sell?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s my job.\u201d \u201cWhat about the paintings they keep?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll appraise them if they want, for insurance, or simply to have a record. They haven\u2019t asked about that.\u201d \u201cHas anyone else?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019d like me to let you know if anyone does.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen I will. If money was the reason, I hope you not only find them, catch them, but they live a long, miserable life in prison.\u201d \u201cWhen we find them, catch them, I expect they will. Thanks for your help.\u201d They walked outside, headed for the car. \u201cIt\u2019s not money,\u201d Eve said. \u201cMaybe, maybe the killer realizes that\u2019s a handy side benefit, but it\u2019s not money.\u201d \u201cMoney\u2019s not personal, and this was.\u201d \u201cThis was, and is. But making some money off the dead artist? A sweet bonus.\u201d When they reached the car, Eve slid behind the wheel. \u201cWe\u2019ll head over to the memorial.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a little early.\u201d \u201cYeah. This way we can watch people as they come in.\u201d Eve couldn\u2019t claim to have a fondness for memorials, but God knew she\u2019d been to more than her share. The facility was quiet, dignified with its muted colors and subtly flower-scented air. Some light spilled through windows, but even that spilled subtly thanks to filters and privacy screens. The second-floor room contrasted with the subtle, the muted, with vases and urns of boldly colored flowers, with more strewn on a long table of photographs of the memorialized. From childhood, Eve noted, to the end of her life. On the other side of the room, another long table held finger foods, coffee, tea, more flowers. What Eve assumed was a self-portrait stood on an easel at the front of the wide room. On the other side of a standing display of flowers stood another easel with an enlarged photo of Erin and Shauna, pressed cheek to cheek as they smiled out. They hadn\u2019t arrived too early for all, Eve noted. She recognized Erin\u2019s family, and Shauna\u2019s, gathered together near that front display. Shauna, wearing a severe black suit, her bright hair pulled back just as severely, stood with them. When she saw Eve and Peabody, she laid a hand on a woman\u2019s\u2014Erin\u2019s mother\u2019s\u2014arm, then stepped away to cross to them. If she\u2019d looked exhausted on the \u2019link screen earlier, now she looked nearly gray with fatigue. She\u2019d done her best with makeup, but it showed through. \u201cThank you for coming. I don\u2019t suppose you have anything to tell me.\u201d \u201cNot yet.\u201d Shauna just nodded, looked around as if she\u2019d forgotten where she stood. \u201cErin loved flowers. She liked vivid colors. We picked these for our wedding.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re lovely,\u201d Peabody said in her gentle way. \u201cWe wanted what she\u2019d want.\u201d She glanced up as music came on, soft but with a steady beat. And smiled a little. \u201cNo dirges for Erin. She liked vivid music, too. Would you come speak to her family, and mine?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d With Peabody, Eve walked down to the vivid flowers with their bold scents and spoke with the grieving. \u201cIs there nothing?\u201d Erin\u2019s mother had given her daughter her eyes, and now they pleaded with Eve. \u201cNothing you can tell us?\u201d \u201cI can tell you that Erin\u2019s our priority, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to find out who took her life, who took her from you.\u201d \u201cShe was so bright.\u201d The mother looked toward the daughter\u2019s portrait. \u201cSo bright and full of life.\u201d Her husband put his arm around her shoulders as they began to tremble. \u201cCome on now. Let\u2019s sit down a minute. Let\u2019s sit down over here.\u201d People began to sprinkle in, so Eve signaled Peabody. They\u2019d stand in the back. And they\u2019d watch. Angie walked straight over to Erin\u2019s parents, embraced them both. And when Erin\u2019s mother broke down, embraced her again, and just held on. Donna came in, tears already streaming, with Glenda holding her hand. It didn\u2019t surprise her to see Crack and Rochelle come in, both in dark suits. Becca came in, Greg\u2019s arm around her waist as they made their way to Shauna. He held them both in a three-person hug, then kissed Shauna\u2019s forehead. He went to the refreshment table, poured two cups of tea, then walked back to them, urging them to take the cups. Others came, a sprinkle, then a stream. Another older couple\u2014Barney\u2019s parents, Eve identified. They went straight to Shauna, then to her parents. Others she recognized from the party, some of them with other women or with men, some alone. Voices murmured over the music. She spotted Lopez\u2019s grandmother, on the arm of a man with silver hair. And where was Lopez? she wondered. \u201cA lot of people,\u201d Peabody commented. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize all of them.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s one who\u2019s not here.\u201d \u201cYeah, I got that. Pretty strange if she doesn\u2019t at least make an appearance.\u201d Marcus Stillwater rushed in, looked harassed. After a glance at Eve, he muttered, \u201cCaught in traffic, damn it. Told them to leave without me, then got caught in traffic.\u201d He hurried to Shauna, embraced her, then her family, then others. Crack and Rochelle made their way to the back and Eve. \u201cA lot of people cared about that girl,\u201d Crack said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find the one who didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWorking on it.\u201d \u201cThe one who just came in? He\u2019s doing the eulogy. Shauna said she asked him, as she knew he\u2019d handle it. She tried to write something out but worried she\u2019d just break.\u201d \u201cBarely holding on now,\u201d Rochelle murmured. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine.\u201d Stillwater pinned on a mic and stepped to the front of the center of the room. His voice came clear and just loud enough to cut through the murmurs and still them. \u201cOn behalf of Erin\u2019s family, Shauna and her family, thank you all for coming to remember Erin. I\u2019m Marcus, and while I only knew Erin a little more than a year, she brought such light and love into my life.\u201d He spoke, and spoke well, of her as a friend, a woman, an artist. His words brought tears, a little laughter, more tears, and Eve thought probably comfort. When he finished, he invited anyone who wanted to say a few words, tell a story, share their thoughts. Angie spoke of their long friendship; Donna of Erin\u2019s unshakable loyalty. Glenda added more about her talent and her verve. Others shared personal stories. Barney stood behind Becca and Shauna, a hand on each of their shoulders. When Shauna stepped forward, he said something to her. But she shook his hand away and walked to the front. \u201cErin changed my life,\u201d she began in a voice that trembled like the hands she clasped together. \u201cShe expanded my life and she brightened it. Who knew a pair of pink shoes could matter so damn much?\u201d A low ripple of laughter, and she managed a ghost of a smile. \u201cWithout those shoes, she might never have shown me what love is, what it can be, what it needs to be. The sixteen months we had together opened my world, my mind, my heart.\u201d As she spoke of love, Eve caught a movement out of the corner of her eye. Lopez came in. She wore red, stoplight, in-your-face red. A body-skimming dress that stopped at mid-thigh she\u2019d paired with sky-high heels in the same bold color. She moved through the crowd in a saunter that had Eve\u2019s instincts prickling. \u201cThis won\u2019t end well,\u201d she muttered, and started to follow. Lopez stopped a foot from Shauna, put a hand on one hip. \u201cThis is bullshit.\u201d Stillwater moved toward ChiChi, but Shauna shook her head. \u201cLeave her alone. What\u2019s bullshit, ChiChi?\u201d \u201cThis, you, all of it. You standing there with your teary eyes and in your shop clerk\u2019s black suit, talking about Erin like you knew her. You didn\u2019t! You knew what you wanted her to be. You know what you wanted out of her, and it\u2019s bullshit.\u201d Lopez\u2019s grandmother spoke in low Spanish\u2014Eve didn\u2019t need the language to recognize a harsh rebuke. Lopez just flicked a hand. \u201cI knew her. I knew who she was. Not the boring doormat you turned her into. She had life, and you drained it right the hell out of her. You fucking killed her. You bitch, she\u2019s dead because of you.\u201d People gasped, as expected. Stillwater moved forward again, but not before Lopez struck out with a slap that rang in the shocked silence. And neither he nor Eve moved quite fast enough to stop Shauna when her fist jabbed out. Good punch, Eve thought as Stillwater managed to catch Lopez before, eyes rolled up, she crumpled. \u201cShe had that coming.\u201d Shauna heaved out a breath. Instead of gray-tinged fatigue, her face glowed with rage. Those dull eyes went brilliant with it. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry. She had that coming.\u201d The grandparents stood. With dignity, the woman approached Shauna. \u201cWe apologize for ChiChi\u2019s behavior, her disrespect at such a time. We\u2019ll take her home.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s, ah, out.\u201d Stillwater looked up at Shauna with a mix of horror and admiration. \u201cI can carry her out. I guess.\u201d \u201cJust out of the room,\u201d Eve told him. \u201cIf she needs medical attention, we\u2019ll call for it. Then she\u2019ll be charged with assault.\u201d \u201cOh, but\u2014\u201d Shauna started to speak, then stopped at Eve\u2019s sharp, fierce look. \u201cI hit back.\u201d \u201cSelf-defense.\u201d \u201cShe was overwrought,\u201d Ms. Lopez began. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, she was. We\u2019ll give her time to settle down. She\u2019s coming around. If you could take her out so they can continue with the memorial, we\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll make her pay a price.\u201d Ms. Lopez sighed. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s best. We should contact our lawyer. Should she have a lawyer?\u201d \u201cThat would be up to you. She\u2019s entitled to one. If you decide to bring one in, he can come to Cop Central. Peabody, go read Ms. Lopez her rights and ask if she wants medical assistance.\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The grandmother turned to Shauna. \u201cI would apologize to you, Shauna, and to all who came to honor Erin on this solemn occasion.\u201d \u201cNo, se\u00f1ora.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she insisted. \u201cOur very deep apologies. If you\u2019ll excuse us.\u201d With considerable dignity, she took her husband\u2019s arm and walked out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to press charges,\u201d Shauna began. \u201cYes, you do. Actions require consequences. If it all comes down to a slap, she\u2019ll get off with a slap.\u201d \u201cYou think\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to find out. Leave this to us, and finish what you\u2019re here to do.\u201d Eve glanced around the room, at the shocked faces, the fascinated ones, then left them all to it. She walked to where Lopez sat on a sofa with her grandparents, and with Stillwater standing like a baffled and reluctant guard beside Peabody. \u201cGo back in, Marcus,\u201d Eve told him. \u201cDrama\u2019s over.\u201d \u201cSure. Okay. Wow.\u201d \u201cMs. ChiChi Lopez states she doesn\u2019t require any medical assistance at this time.\u201d \u201cFine. Did you inform her of her rights?\u201d \u201cJust more bullshit,\u201d Lopez snapped. \u201cBut she rattled them off.\u201d \u201cChiChi.\u201d For the first time, the grandfather spoke, and in tones of absolute authority. \u201cMind your tongue.\u201d She set her bruised jaw, pressed her lips\u2014the full bottom one split on the corner\u2014together. And said nothing more. \u201cWe\u2019ll forgo the cuffs,\u201d Eve told her, \u201cunless you want more trouble.\u201d \u201cGo with them.\u201d Her grandmother patted Lopez\u2019s hand, then rose. \u201cBehave sensibly. The lawyer will come if needed.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need a damn\u2014\u201d She broke off at her grandfather\u2019s cold stare. \u201cYes, Abuela, thank you.\u201d Getting to her feet, Lopez walked between Eve and Peabody. \u201cIt is bullshit.\u201d She snarled it once she was out of earshot. \u201cAnd you know it. So I slapped the bitch. Big deal.\u201d \u201cYeah, big deal known as assault. Add verbal assault for good measure, and let\u2019s kick in disturbing the peace just for the hell of it.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t say otherwise. I\u2019m also doing my job.\u201d Outside, she put a hand on Lopez\u2019s head as she put her in the back of the car. \u201cWe could throw in public drunkenness, couldn\u2019t we, Peabody?\u201d \u201cWell, Lieutenant, she\u2019s definitely had more than a couple this morning.\u201d \u201cSo I had a couple of drinks. I\u2019m old enough, and someone I cared about is dead. Dead because of that stupid, whiny bitch.\u201d Eve pulled out into traffic. \u201cAnd how, exactly, is Erin dead because of Shauna?\u201d \u201cJesus, are you stupid?\u201d \u201cJesus, Peabody, am I stupid?\u201d \u201cI would say the opposite of stupid. Especially when it comes to murder.\u201d \u201cWhy, thank you, Peabody, for that vote of confidence. But, ChiChi, since you ask, why do you think I might be stupid?\u201d \u201cBecause it\u2019s freaking obvious.\u201d Wincing, she cradled her jaw as she snapped the words out. \u201cIf not for that prissy-ass bitch, Erin would still be alive.\u201d Willing to play, and understanding the rules, Peabody shifted to look back. \u201cSo Shauna killed Erin?\u201d \u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake. Not just stupid, brain-dead. She wouldn\u2019t have the guts. She doesn\u2019t have the spine. Or the brains. Some second-rate shoe store manager playing at getting naked with another woman. For kicks. For adventure.\u201d \u201cSince they planned to get married this weekend, it sounds like more than playing. More than kicks and adventure.\u201d \u201cMaybe she\u2019d have gone through with it for the splash, for the attention. But it wouldn\u2019t last anyway.\u201d Eve pulled into the garage. \u201cHow about we try this? Since you\u2019re so much smarter about this than we are, we\u2019ll go up, sit in Interview. You can tell us your thoughts. We\u2019ll put off processing you for the assault.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck about the assault.\u201d \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t give one about a formal interview.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Peabody assisted Lopez out of the car, guided her to the elevator. \u201cDo you want some Sober-Up before said interview?\u201d Eve asked her. \u201cI\u2019m not drunk, for Christ\u2019s sake. I had a couple of drinks.\u201d They flanked her in the elevator. \u201cJaw\u2019s swollen,\u201d Eve commented. \u201cFuck you.\u201d \u201cBack at you, but Detective Peabody will get you an ice pack.\u201d When the doors opened for more cops, Eve edged Lopez back. For once, she\u2019d ride all the way up. And as she did, she watched some of the bravado erode. \u201cI got us Interview B, Lieutenant.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d \u201cMy family will take care of bail. I don\u2019t need this crap.\u201d \u201cInterview first, and maybe we can convince the injured party to drop the charges.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d But she did, Eve thought. Now that the bravado, some of the Dutch courage wore thin, and the situation took hold, she gave more than a shit. \u201cThen, again, you shouldn\u2019t give one about an interview.\u201d Taking Lopez by the arm, Eve led her out of the elevator on Homicide\u2019s level. \u201cWant something to drink?\u201d she asked easily. \u201cVodka martini, very dry, two olives.\u201d \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll get that for you in about never. How about some water, Peabody, all around?\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d As Peabody peeled off, Lopez sneered. \u201cFigures you\u2019d go by \u2018sir,\u2019 like a man.\u201d \u201cDoes it? Funny, I think of it as genderless respect, but it takes all kinds.\u201d She opened the door to Interview B. \u201cHave a seat. Record on. Dallas, Lieutenant Eve, entering Interview with Lopez, ChiChi, on the matter of H-7823, and due to assault charges pending. Were you read your rights regarding those assault charges, Ms. Lopez?\u201d \u201cYeah, and assault\u2019s bullshit. You know it\u2019s bullshit.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, I personally witnessed your assault on Shauna Hunnicut roughly twenty minutes ago.\u201d \u201cSo I slapped the bitch. She\u2019s earned worse.\u201d \u201cNote that the accused has admitted to said assault. Peabody, Detective Delia, entering Interview. And how has Ms. Hunnicut earned worse than a slap?\u201d \u201cErin\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Teeth bared, she snarled it out. \u201cAre you accusing Ms. Hunnicut of killing Erin Albright?\u201d \u201cLike she\u2019d have the guts, or the spine, or the smarts.\u201d Gingerly, Lopez pressed the ice pack Peabody offered against her jaw. \u201cBut she\u2019s the reason,\u201d ChiChi continued. \u201cIt\u2019s her fault. It\u2019s all her fault.\u201d Eve cracked her tube of water, took a casual sip. \u201cSince we\u2019re all sitting here, how about you explain how Erin\u2019s death is Shauna\u2019s fault.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t know her, all right? You didn\u2019t know Erin.\u201d \u201cBut you did,\u201d Peabody said, her voice as gentle as Lopez\u2019s was strident. \u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right I knew her. She was bright and bold, really fearless. She had passion. Real passion. For her art, for life, for living life. Up for anything, that was Erin. Always on the go, always doing, looking, being. Shauna killed all that. She killed all of that before somebody finished the job.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d Those dark eyes bored into Eve\u2019s. \u201cShe manipulated her. Playing at the romance, all of it. Suddenly, Erin\u2019s staying home instead of partying. She\u2019s working on her art, sure, but she\u2019s not fucking living. Doesn\u2019t go out, starts hanging with those lame friends of Shauna\u2019s. It\u2019s all Shauna, Shauna, Shauna, all the damn time.\u201d \u201cAnd not you. Not after Shauna.\u201d \u201cTells me to lay off Shauna. \u2018Oh, come on, ChiChi, don\u2019t be bitchy.\u2019 Says how happy she is, but bullshit. Laughs it off when I make a move on her, the way she used to like.\u201d \u201cThat must\u2019ve hurt.\u201d Peabody\u2019s eyes shined with sympathy. \u201cFucking A, it hurt, but it showed me just how Shauna twisted her up. Like the two of us can\u2019t have sex anymore? Like she can\u2019t swing by the club for some laughs? No, oh no, they\u2019re saving money for a nice fucking sofa? Then, Jesus, they\u2019re getting married? What the serious fuck!\u201d \u201cYou resented all that,\u201d Eve said. \u201cWho could blame you? You and Erin had something. Then Shauna got in the way.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m telling you, she manipulated Erin. She dazzled her somehow. White dresses, a wedding? Maybe having kids down the road? That wasn\u2019t Erin.\u201d \u201cWhat did you do about it?\u201d Eve asked her. \u201cI tried talking to her, but she wouldn\u2019t listen. I tried warning the bitch off, but she ignored me. I even tried talking to Angie, since she and Erin are tight, but she told me Erin was happy, in love, and I\u2019d end up having her cut me off if I kept it up. \u201cAnd Donna.\u201d Lopez rolled her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s useless. Whatever Erin wants is just perfect. Erin wants Shauna, so Shauna\u2019s perfect. They couldn\u2019t see what I could. None of them could see what I saw.\u201d \u201cDid you tell Erin you were in love with her, ChiChi?\u201d At Eve\u2019s words, Lopez\u2019s eyes filled. Tears fell in a flood. \u201cShe said she was sorry. Sorry! But she didn\u2019t feel that way about me. She couldn\u2019t feel that way. She loved Shauna. She was making a life with Shauna, and she was sorry.\u201d \u201cWhen did you tell her?\u201d \u201cThe morning of the goddamn party. The morning before she died. Died because she thought she loved Shauna. And she\u2019s spending the last morning of her life cleaning somebody\u2019s apartment.\u201d \u201cYou went there.\u201d \u201cYes, I went there. I went there to tell her. I went there to stop her from making this stupid mistake.\u201d \u201cIs that when she gave you the case, the case with the tickets to Hawaii?\u201d Like a child in a tantrum, she tossed the ice pack across the table. \u201cShe didn\u2019t give me the goddamn case. She didn\u2019t tell me anything about Hawaii. I knew that was Shauna\u2019s thing. I knew how much Erin wanted to make it happen, but she didn\u2019t tell me. Because Shauna, always Shauna.\u201d Now she laid her head down on the interview table and wept. \u201cShe\u2019d be alive if it wasn\u2019t for Shauna. Why didn\u2019t they kill her? Stupid, second-rate shoe clerk with her boring friends and let\u2019s-stay-home lifestyle. Who\u2019d miss the bitch? Erin was so much more. So much more.\u201d \u201cAnd feeling this way, you still went to the party that night?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got my pride, don\u2019t I? I\u2019m not sitting at home alone. I\u2019m not letting them all see how it hurts.\u201d Straightening, she swiped at her face. Took a long moment to compose herself. The anger hadn\u2019t drained, Eve thought, not by a long shot. But when she spoke again, her voice was more controlled. \u201cI\u2019d have made Erin happy. We could\u2019ve had a real life together and not some pale, boring excuse for one. Now she\u2019s dead, and that pasty-faced redhead\u2019s standing up there talking about her like they had some love of a lifetime. \u201cShe\u2019s lucky I just slapped her.\u201d She took two deep breaths. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have lasted. Erin would\u2019ve gotten tired of it, she\u2019d have wanted to bust loose again, and that bitch would\u2019ve wanted a dick again. But now Erin\u2019s dead, and it\u2019s over.\u201d \u201cKilling her, that\u2019s payback for rejection.\u201d Eyes dry again, Lopez stared at Eve. \u201cLook at me, for Christ\u2019s sake. She\u2019d have come back to me, to the life, to the passions. I could wait. Yeah, I was pissed, but I could wait. Now, because of Shauna, there\u2019s nothing to wait for.\u201d \u201cBlaming Erin for wanting someone, something else makes more sense.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t know her,\u201d Lopez said again. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have lasted. She\u2019d have come back. I could wait. Now she can\u2019t come back. And all because of Shauna\u2019s goddamn party. I don\u2019t give a fuck about the assault. Lock me up. Erin\u2019s still dead, so the fuck what?\u201d \u201cWhat did you think when you saw Shauna stripping down onstage at the D&D?\u201d Eve wondered. \u201cI thought, Jesus, Erin\u2019s giving up this\u201d\u2014Lopez skimmed her hands down her body\u2014\u201cfor that? And I damn well knew she\u2019d come back.\u201d Looking into Lopez\u2019s eyes, Eve nodded. \u201cYeah, I bet that\u2019s just what you thought. Peabody, take Ms. Lopez down to Booking. You can sit and think some more before your bail hearing.\u201d Eve sat back. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Erin, but I know her now. Knowing her\u2019s part of my job, and I\u2019m damn good at my job. Only one person\u2019s responsible for her death, and that\u2019s the one who killed her. If it helps you sleep at night to blame the woman she loved and who loved her, that\u2019s your damage. But I\u2019ll do my job and see the person responsible\u2019s held responsible.\u201d \u201cShauna\u2019s why she\u2019s dead. That\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d \u201cGet her out, Peabody. Interview end.\u201d \n Chapter Nineteen While she waited for Peabody, Eve wrote up her report, made more notes on the interview. She heard someone coming toward her office\u2014not Peabody. But she recognized the tread and got to her feet. Commander Whitney filled the doorway, then her office. Broad-shouldered in his suit, the same color as the gray threaded through his close-cropped hair, he flicked a glance at her board. Eve said, \u201cSir.\u201d He gave an absent wave of his hand toward her desk chair, but she didn\u2019t sit. \u201cYou arrested, interviewed, and are now booking a ChiChi Lopez.\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d He nodded, and now his dark eyes flicked toward her AutoChef. Eve didn\u2019t ask, simply programmed coffee, black, and offered it. He nodded again. \u201cOn assault.\u201d \u201cYes, sir. Also drunk and disorderly and disturbing the peace. Ms. Lopez disrupted a memorial service, then verbally and physically assaulted the fianc\u00e9e of the deceased.\u201d \u201cI take it since you wouldn\u2019t waste your time interviewing this individual over an assault while conducting a murder investigation, said individual is on your case board.\u201d \u201cShe is.\u201d \u201cShe is,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve received and reviewed copies of your reports. Also received a call from the mayor, who is a frequent patron of the family restaurant.\u201d Politics, Eve thought, and struggled not to hiss. \u201cThe grandmother contacted the mayor?\u201d \u201cThe mother. Apparently there\u2019s a family disagreement on the issue. Due to the nature of the younger Ms. Lopez\u2019s career, the mayor would like to keep a low profile on any involvement.\u201d \u201cI bet. Sir.\u201d Whitney\u2019s mouth twitched, just a little. \u201cIn any case, the mayor\u2019s office would like to see some leeway on the matter, due to the emotional state of all parties involved.\u201d \u201cI believe that will be up to the court, Commander.\u201d \u201cAgreed. I\u2019m on my way out to a meeting or I wouldn\u2019t have interrupted you with this. While the mayor is also in agreement, the Lopezes\u2019 enchiladas are exceptional. And one of the younger Ms. Lopez\u2019s cousins works in the mayor\u2019s office.\u201d Eve said nothing while he polished off his coffee, handed her back the mug. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve done my duty, and have no doubt you\u2019ll do yours.\u201d He started for the door, then stopped, turned back. \u201cIs she your killer?\u201d \u201cShe has the nature and temperament for it, Commander. She\u2019s the center of her own world, and expects to be treated as such. A slap back by the court wouldn\u2019t hurt. But no, sir, I don\u2019t think she killed Erin Albright.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure that will be a relief to the Lopez family, and the mayor. Have you got the scent?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cThen good hunting, Lieutenant.\u201d When he left, Eve turned back to her board. Yeah, she had the scent. What she didn\u2019t have was evidence. She believed, strongly, in following her gut. But without evidence, she couldn\u2019t make a case. Now she heard Peabody coming. \u201cI saw Whitney as I was coming back. Is there a problem?\u201d \u201cThe mayor likes Abuela\u2019s enchiladas.\u201d \u201cOh. Well, shit.\u201d Eve shook her head. \u201cNo real interference there.\u201d \u201cOkay, good. Lopez is with her lawyer. The lawyer came in during booking. She was wearing Carminas.\u201d \u201cCarmina\u2019s what?\u201d \u201cShoes, Dallas. Carmina is a shoe designer, a goddess. These were a pale, pale blue. Stilettos with little cutouts on the sides shaped like butterflies. They\u2019re going to run like five grand, easy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just thrilled to have a report on the lawyer\u2019s footwear.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s relevant,\u201d Peabody insisted. \u201cIf you can afford Carminas, and you\u2019re wearing a suit that looks like it came right off the runway in Milan, you\u2019re probably really good at your job.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll probably bounce with community service and anger management.\u201d \u201cThat seems \u2026 fair.\u201d \u201cIt would be. Unless she pulls a judge who decides to dismiss the charges. There should be consequences, but that\u2019s not our department. We did our job.\u201d \u201cYeah, but she didn\u2019t kill Erin Albright.\u201d Eve gestured to the desk chair. \u201cTake the chair, I\u2019m not ready to sit yet.\u201d And she programmed coffee for both of them. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she kill Erin Albright?\u201d \u201cLogistically,\u201d Peabody began, \u201cit would\u2019ve been tricky. Not impossible, but tricky. It feels like if she was going to do it, she\u2019d have found a less tricky time and place.\u201d Eve decided to counter, and make Peabody work for it. \u201cThe time and place are part of the point of the killing. Ruining a celebration and destroying a dream at the same time.\u201d \u201cYeah, but \u2026 Lopez is a hard-ass with a goddess complex. \u2018I\u2019m so special, I\u2019m so amazing. Look at me!\u2019 And I can see her shoving a sharp into somebody\u2019s throat. Or yeah, using a wire. But if she was going to do it, I think she\u2019d have killed Shauna. And she\u2019d have felt like she deserved to.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Erin who rejected her. She probably hasn\u2019t heard a lot of nos in her life, and Erin gave her a big no. And Shauna pays. And pays. And pays.\u201d Peabody frowned at her coffee, then frowned at the board. \u201cYeah, but \u2026 the way she broke down in Interview, what she said, how she said it. I really believe she loved Erin, or honestly thinks she did. And yeah, people kill what they love, and a lot, but this didn\u2019t feel like the way for her. \u201cShe runs hot, Dallas, really hot. And there had to be a lot of cold to plan out and execute this killing. Maybe a hot motive\u2014the passion\u2014but a cold execution.\u201d \u201cOh, she has plenty of cold in there.\u201d Deflated, Peabody set down her coffee. \u201cYou think she did it.\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Peabody looked up again, blinked. \u201cYou don\u2019t? Why?\u201d \u201cFor all the reasons you cited, and a couple more. If she killed Erin, where\u2019s the murder weapon? She didn\u2019t have it on her, it wasn\u2019t in the club. Sweepers went through dumpsters and recyclers, circled the block on that\u2014which she\u2019d have had to do if she had a bloody garrote on her.\u201d \u201cI forgot that one. I shouldn\u2019t have forgotten that one.\u201d \u201cShe could\u2019ve ditched it somehow. Snipped the wire to pieces, flushed. Had to have handles, but it\u2019s possible she found a way to destroy and dispose. Possible, but that\u2019s a lot of thought, and it would take more time. Then she\u2019s going to walk back into the club, slip in without notice, and keep partying?\u201d Eve shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t see her pulling it off. I can see her trying but failing. She\u2019s a performer, but that\u2019s her body, not so much her face. Something would\u2019ve showed. If Crack didn\u2019t see something in her, Angie would have. She\u2019s got a sharp eye.\u201d Eve wandered, drank coffee. \u201cAll of those points can, as I demonstrated, be countered. I hope she pays a price for what she did today, but she won\u2019t go down for murder.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s Greg Barney.\u201d \u201cI know it is now.\u201d Turning, Eve studied his face on her board. Attractive, well-groomed, well-dressed, an easy, friendly smile. \u201cHe smirked.\u201d \u201cSorry? What? He smirked? At Lopez today?\u201d \u201cNo, not at Lopez, at Shauna. Between the slap and the punch. Lopez goes after Shauna verbally. Everybody\u2019s shocked, but he\u2019s fascinated. There were a couple more fascinated. And a couple of angry reactions. Angie, for instance, was pissed. Then the slap.\u201d Certain of her ground, Eve turned back around. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that split second, that\u2014\u201d Eve snapped her fingers. \u201cEverybody\u2019s holy shit, or what the fuck. But he smirked. He\u2019s looking right at Shauna with that red blaze from Lopez\u2019s hand across her cheek, and he smirks. Like: Yeah, nice job. He covered it fast; he\u2019s got a good mask. But I saw it. Smirked, and you bet your ass he had to swallow a laugh.\u201d \u201cUm, are there counterpoints?\u201d \u201cOh, plenty. Involuntary reaction, nervous twitch.\u201d Eve shrugged. \u201cBut he enjoyed that moment. He enjoyed watching Shauna\u2019s emotional speech interrupted by a hostile drunk. And he seriously enjoyed the slap.\u201d She tapped her lapel. \u201cI turned on my recorder when Lopez started her rant.\u201d \u201cYou recorded the smirk?\u201d \u201cI had a decent angle. I\u2019m going to have EDD enhance it. A smirk\u2019s not evidence, and we\u2019ve got precious little. But I add that to the nerves outside the apartment, the way he handled the box. Add it to the no-alibi that was perfectly presented as alibi, the high school relationship, the hovering.\u201d \u201cYou think he\u2019s in love with Shauna?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think he loves anyone but himself.\u201d She eased a hip on the side of her desk, then pushed off again. No, not ready to sit. \u201cHe lost the Shaun part of Shaunbar. He\u2019d been a star in high school, but part of that shine came from her, being coupled with her. Then they\u2019re back home after college, but she moved to the city. So he moves to the city, practically on top of her.\u201d \u201cThe hovering.\u201d \u201cAnd the access to that shine. But she\u2019s not interested in going back to high school. So he starts up with her good friend and the self-identified high school wheeze. Gets some shine there. And Shauna\u2019s not really with anyone, or not with anyone for long.\u201d \u201cUntil Erin.\u201d \u201cUntil Erin.\u201d \u201cThat changes everything,\u201d Peabody said, picking up the threads. \u201cShe\u2019s in her first real relationship since him.\u201d \u201cAnd she switched teams,\u201d Eve added. Peabody frowned again. \u201cDo you think that matters?\u201d \u201cTo him, yeah, it does. It matters to him. It\u2019s salt-in-the-wound time for someone like Barney. Look at his background, Peabody. His family is nearly universally straight, WASPy types. Any who aren\u2019t tend to move away. You hook up with someone of the opposite sex, eventually marry in that sector, preferably of the same race, culture, and likely creed if you\u2019ve got one. You live a traditional, by those standards, life and produce a kid or possibly two. Divorce is frowned upon, so choose that life mate wisely.\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019s not with Shauna, and hasn\u2019t been for years. Why would it matter so much, matter enough to kill?\u201d \u201cBecause she still belongs to him.\u201d She tapped the board, Barney\u2019s photo, then Lopez\u2019s. \u201cThey\u2019re a lot alike, these two. Self-important, the center of their own worlds, tight families where, I\u2019d say, they\u2019re well loved, even admired.\u201d They both fit the profile, she thought, because they were very much alike. \u201cBoth of them used to getting their way. Instead of letting it play out, hire a fancy lawyer and let it play out, Lopez\u2019s mother whines to the mayor. The fucking mayor, when her daughter gets busted for being a raging, violent asshole. I\u2019m betting if Barney hit any bumps along the way, his family found a way to smooth them, too.\u201d \u201cAppearances,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cLooks, status\u2014those are top priorities for them. Yeah.\u201d Thoughtfully, she nodded. \u201cYeah, both of them. And they were both sort of stars in high school, right? She had all those write-ups about her dancing, and he was part of The Couple.\u201d \u201cAnd neither of them had the same shine in college. Smaller fish, bigger pool. Still, they\u2019re entitled, both of them. She\u2019s got family money behind her, but he does well enough. They\u2019re both attractive and wouldn\u2019t have trouble with those hookups.\u201d \u201cExcept for her, Erin,\u201d Peabody added, \u201cand for him, Shauna.\u201d \u201cExactly. For her, I don\u2019t think she realized how deep her feelings were for Erin until Erin was dead, so it starts with jealousy. With him? It\u2019s pride, not passion. If he wants Shauna back, it\u2019s not love, not lust, not passion. Straight pride. He may actually feel some of the love, lust, passion for Becca\u2014she pretty well suits his needs. But he doesn\u2019t feel enough to let go of the shine.\u201d Eve eased the hip on her desk again, and this time stayed, let out a breath. \u201cAnd none of that\u2019s evidence. None of that builds a solid case. So the question is?\u201d \u201cHow do we prove it?\u201d \u201cHow do we prove it?\u201d Eve echoed. \u201cI thought leaving the case was a mistake\u2014panic or just stupidity\u2014but I\u2019m more convinced than ever that was deliberate, a part of it. Shauna had to pay, too, for bruising that pride.\u201d She pointed at Peabody. \u201cWhat do you want to bet Shauna shared that dream with Barney back in high school. Their dream honeymoon.\u201d \u201cNo bet.\u201d Peabody scooped a hand through the air. \u201cIt slides right in.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the salt in the wound again, for him. So he gives it right back to her. Fickle bitch won\u2019t be going to Maui now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just mean.\u201d \u201cYeah, and again, the mean\u2019s part of the point. He had the motive, means, and opportunity. Erin gave him the perfect opportunity. Here\u2019s a difference between him and Lopez, as I see it. Lopez would\u2019ve waited Erin out, sure the relationship, even tied up in marriage, wouldn\u2019t last. He couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d \u201cBecause, for one thing, it\u2019s a personal insult.\u201d Now Eve smiled. \u201cThere you go. He had that weapon ready, maybe planning to kill her before the wedding. Maybe at the damn wedding. But the Maui thing, that couldn\u2019t be tolerated, plus, perfect opportunity.\u201d She pushed off the desk to pace again. \u201cErin asks him to help her with the big surprise because she trusts him. Why wouldn\u2019t she? He\u2019s not so much part of the tribe, right, but of the circle. He\u2019s Shauna\u2019s good friend, he\u2019s Becca\u2019s cohab. He\u2019s not going to the party\u2014girls only\u2014so it\u2019d be easy to get him the case, the swipe, give him what she thinks is the basic timing. \u2018Just come in the back way.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s \u2018Okay, sure, no problem.\u2019 The good friend, the good guy, all happy to help.\u201d \u201cSlip in, do the kill. Need to take her \u2019link, as there\u2019s some communication on that, but he\u2019s going to stage a robbery anyway. Shouldn\u2019t have picked a place like the D&D\u2014that\u2019s insulting, too. A sex club? That\u2019s not the place for Shauna. He covered himself well. Close the shop himself\u2014so we have that security footage. Meet a mutual friend at a place he\u2019s known. Buy the damn flowers.\u201d \u201cThen go home, bide your time, turn on the screen.\u201d Peabody picked up the threads again. \u201cMake sure it\u2019s programmed for something you can say you watched at the time of the murder.\u201d \u201cTake the case, the weapon, and have a short walk in the rain. He has to let her know he\u2019s there\u2014send a quick text or get one\u2014because he\u2019d still have the swipe. She slips away, a little drunk, a lot excited. And he\u2019s right there. He has to move fast, the minute she shuts the door. \u201cIt\u2019s easier than he thinks.\u201d She could see it. She could fucking see it. \u201cEasier, quicker. It\u2019s horrible, all that blood, but it\u2019s done. Take the \u2019link, the little bit of jewelry, leave the swipe, and get out.\u201d \u201cHe could\u2019ve walked for blocks to ditch the weapon,\u201d Peabody added, \u201cthe \u2019link and jewelry, too.\u201d \u201cNot too far, but far enough. He has to be home when Becca tags him. He needs to be home so she can say he was home when the body\u2019s discovered and she tags him.\u201d \u201cYou have to be right about the communication on the \u2019link. If we can just cobble together enough probable cause to look at his.\u201d \u201cIf he\u2019s smart, and he is, he\u2019d have destroyed it and gotten a new one. Contact Mira, see about getting me a consult. I want to run all this by her. I need to finish the report on Lopez and I want to swing up to EDD.\u201d \u201cEDD?\u201d \u201cI want Feeney to take a look at the smirk. I\u2019m not basing the investigation on that, but it was the capper. Meanwhile, do a search for people who graduated with him and the two women. Get impressions.\u201d \u201cHey, that\u2019s a good angle. I\u2019ll be all over it.\u201d Eve sat, finished the report. She spent a little more time on her notes, laying on her very circumstantial evidence against Greg Barney. She took the glides to EDD\u2014less crowded, more thinking time\u2014then walked into the geek carnival of EDD. Color, movement, sound. Everyone jiggled, pranced, or shook in their bibs and baggies with the stripes, checks, swirls thereon making constantly changing patterns. E-speak rolled like a strange, foreign language. She spotted McNab, airboots shuffling, bony hips ticktocking, red-streaked blond tail of hair swaying. She turned to the brown and beige sanctuary of Feeney\u2019s office. He sat, worn brown shoes crossed on his desk. With his explosion of ginger hair, wiry with threads of silver, a wild crown on his head, he tipped back in his wrinkled shit-brown suit, baggy eyes closed in his hangdog face. Before she could step back, he held up a finger. \u201cThinking, not sleeping.\u201d In about eight seconds, he nodded; a satisfied smile bloomed. \u201cOkay, got it.\u201d And opened his eyes. He got up, walked to his wall screen. He held up another finger\u2014just wait\u2014then changed the position of some lines of code or equations or whatever the hell she couldn\u2019t have translated with a stunner shoved in her ear. \u201cAnd there it is.\u201d He swiped something else she could interpret as save, copy, send. Seconds later, someone in the bullpen shouted: \u201cWee-oh! Dunked it! Wee-oh, Cap!\u201d \u201cFucking-A right.\u201d He stepped back, picked up the lopsided bowl his wife had made, and snagged some candied almonds before offering the bowl to Eve. She started to shake her head, changed her mind, popped two. \u201cWhatcha after, kid?\u201d Feeney asked her. \u201cI sent up a recording,\u201d she began. \u201cYeah, yeah, got that right here. Had to deal with this one first.\u201d He went back around behind his desk. Manually brought the recording on-screen where she\u2019d cued it. \u201cThe redhead\u2019s about to get clocked by the brunette,\u201d Feeney observed. \u201cYeah. The guy, off to the left, behind the redhead, beside the blonde\u2014reddish blonde\u2026\u201d Strawberry blonde\u2014essentially a redhead, she realized. He went from one redhead to another. Interesting. \u201cThat guy,\u201d she continued. \u201cWatch him, okay? Run it to just after the slap and tell me what you see.\u201d Eve turned to watch again herself without blocking Feeney\u2019s view. Over the gasps and murmurs, the crack of flesh to flesh snapped. \u201cThat one hurt. And he liked it.\u201d He paused it where Shauna\u2019s head reared back and Lopez\u2019s open hand had just started to drop. \u201cRight? First, I want to enhance until it\u2019s as close to the four of them\u2014slapper, slappee, smirker, and the blonde\u2014as we can get.\u201d Those basset hound eyes gave her a long look. \u201cYou know enough to do this.\u201d \u201cYeah, and I did, but the angle\u2019s a little tricky.\u201d He enhanced, zoomed, sharpened. \u201cLike that?\u201d \u201cYeah, slo-mo it back to right before she swings, then advance slow-mo to this point again. See? See how he puts his arm around the blonde\u2019s shoulders?\u201d \u201cLooks like she was going to move in, maybe try to stop the brunette.\u201d \u201cAnd he stopped her. And then how he looks sort of shocked, but\u2014\u201d \u201cMore like he\u2019s holding in a laugh.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d Vindication had Eve mentally pumping her fist. \u201cYes, yes, then the brunette swings, connects, and what do you see?\u201d \u201cFucker\u2019s smirking.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s smirking. Now, if you\u2019re at a memorial for the fianc\u00e9e of one of your oldest, closest friends, do you smirk when she gets clocked?\u201d \u201cHell no.\u201d Feeney zoomed out again, then ran it back. \u201cSee the guy on the right? He\u2019s pissed and moving in. If he\u2019d gotten there before the brunette took that swing, she wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve taken it.\u201d \u201cI need a copy of the zoom and enhance, then if you can do the same with his face. The smirking fucker.\u201d Feeney nodded, worked his magic. \u201cThis the one who killed the fianc\u00e9e?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t prove it, yet, but I\u2019m damn sure of it.\u201d \u201cGood-looking face. All-American boy. When it smirks like that, it\u2019s punchable.\u201d As Eve studied the enhanced close-up, Detective Callendar strolled in. \u201cHey, Cap\u2014 Sorry, Dallas, didn\u2019t see you. I\u2019ll swing back.\u201d In her orange bibs and a tee that looked as if someone had tossed green paint on a white canvas, she started to step back. \u201cHey, I know that dooser. Where do I know that dooser?\u201d Eve remembered the word\u2014dick/loser\u2014and sent Callendar a sharp look. \u201cYou know him? Greg Barney?\u201d \u201cNot the name, but that face. That asshole smirk. Check it!\u201d she said, and lifted a hand. \u201cFancy men\u2019s shop guy, downtown shop.\u201d \u201cHow do you know him?\u201d \u201cNot know-know, but he\u2019s the one who gave me that same snarky look when I went in there.\u201d She dug into one of the many pockets of her bags, pulled out a pack of gum. She offered it to Eve, who shook her head, then to Feeney, who took one before Callendar took one herself. \u201cMy brother\u2019s twenty-first birthday, back several months, and what does he want but this fancy shirt from this fancy designer. Seems this place was having a sale, so I poke in. And this guy, he\u2019s watching me like I\u2019m going to grab shit up and run for it.\u201d She shrugged, tossed her short, streaky dark hair. \u201cSo okay, I don\u2019t look like most people who shop there. Then when I find the stupid shirt\u2014it\u2019s just a freaking tee, but it\u2019s got the fancy guy\u2019s label on it, which means they can charge easy ten times as much\u2014and I hold it up to check it out, he comes marching over. Tells me how they prefer people don\u2019t handle the merchandise. I say how I\u2019m thinking of buying it and is it on sale?\u201d Snapping her gum, she slid her hands into hip pockets. \u201cHe gives me that look right there. Like I\u2019m a bug and he\u2019s the boot that\u2019s going to really love squashing me. He says how that designer never goes on sale, and how I should try the L&W for a more affordable knock-off. He pissed me off so much I bought that damn shirt, full price. But my brother freaking loves it, and it was his twenty-first.\u201d Callendar smirked back at the smirk. \u201cIs he a vic or a suspect?\u201d \u201cSuspect.\u201d \u201cHope you nail him good and hard.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the plan. Can you copy all that for me, Feeney, and send?\u201d \u201cAlready did. Thinking time,\u201d he told her. \u201cTake some.\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to. Soon as I can. Thanks. You, too, Callendar.\u201d As she started out through the color, movement, and sound, her \u2019link signaled. She pulled it out as she went, scanned the text from Peabody. Mira just got a window. She can give you about fifteen if you go now. On my way. Keep pushing on the high school angle. Move to college if possible. Back in twenty. Movement, she thought as she hopped on a glide. Callendar had given her a new perspective of the man his friends described as a nice guy, a helpful guy, an average guy. There would be other perspectives, too. Maybe enough when they put them all together, that would give her some buttons to push. \n Chapter Twenty The dragon who guarded Mira\u2019s office didn\u2019t look very pleased when Eve strode in. But she tapped her earpiece. \u201cDr. Mira, Lieutenant Dallas is here. Yes, I will. Go right in.\u201d She slanted Eve a look. \u201cYou\u2019re on the clock, Lieutenant.\u201d \u201cUnderstood.\u201d Eve gave the door a quick knock, then stepped inside. Mira already stood, programming what Eve knew would be tea. She wore a slim, plum-colored dress with a short white jacket, and heels that merged the two colors with tiny checks. A gold chain with little, flat pearly disks draped down the purple bodice. Even smaller pearly disks dangled with purple ones from her ears. It never failed to amaze Eve how Mira managed it. \u201cI had a couple minutes to look over your report,\u201d Mira said as the flowery scent of the tea wafted into the air. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. Have a seat.\u201d Eve took one of Mira\u2019s two blue scoop chairs, accepted the tea in its fancy cup. Mira tucked a strand of mink-colored hair behind her ear and took the other. \u201cI found your side notes even more interesting. I sometimes wonder if you\u2019re bucking for my job.\u201d \u201cNot hardly.\u201d Mira smiled. \u201cYou\u2019d be good at it. But then part of being a good investigator is understanding who and what people are. ChiChi Lopez, definitely narcissistic tendencies, but much of her sense of self-worth is tied to her physicality, and more narrowly, her sexuality. A difficult woman who uses that physicality and sex to attain what she wants. Attention, approval, admiration.\u201d Mira sipped some tea. \u201cIt may be different with her family, but in her other relationships, emotions, genuine emotions, have played little part. So when she finds herself with genuine feelings for Erin Albright, and these feelings aren\u2019t returned, her resentment, her anger, and her bafflement are aimed at the person Erin has feelings for.\u201d \u201cNot at Erin.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not my read, no. Erin had to be misled, somehow deceived, as in every way Lopez\u2014to her mind\u2014is superior to her rival. Even that confident superiority isn\u2019t enough as time passes. The rival must become a trickster, a manipulator, a liar, a cheat, a user. And in the end, when Erin is killed, the rival must be responsible, must take the blame.\u201d Mira paused, smiled again. \u201cWhich, clearly, you concluded yourself.\u201d \u201cMore or less. If Albright had been killed with a handy blunt object, I\u2019d narrow on her. Crime of passion, heat of the moment, I could see it. But to plan it out like this, execute it like this? If Hunnicut was the victim, again, I\u2019d narrow on Lopez.\u201d \u201cI absolutely agree. So. Greg Barney.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to add something I just learned, via Detective Callendar.\u201d Eve relayed the story. \u201cHearing that story didn\u2019t surprise you,\u201d Mira commented. \u201cNo. You, either.\u201d \u201cNo, but again, some of our work runs in the same lane of human behavior. He enjoys his social standing, again as he sees it. From a solidly, dependably upper-middle-class background, and a classically traditional one, he rose a bit above as a teenager. Class president, star athlete, and a pairing with a popular and attractive girl that made them both stars in that arena. I don\u2019t believe either of us will be surprised to find at least some\u2014especially on lower rungs of the social ladder\u2014of his former schoolmates won\u2019t remember him with particular fondness.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a bully,\u201d Eve said, \u201cbut not an obvious one. He hovers, observes, insinuates, placates. He\u2019s ridden some on his looks, like Lopez. His job makes him a kind of boss, and in a shiny venue. Both are important to him. Appearances are important to him. I\u2019ve seen Becca\u2019s high school pictures, and he wouldn\u2019t have looked twice at her back then. But since? She\u2026\u201d \u201cBlossomed?\u201d \u201cOkay, that works. She found a style that suits her, developed confidence in herself, her looks, her work. But he didn\u2019t move to the city for Becca\u2014even if he knew she already lived and worked here. He moved because of Shauna.\u201d \u201cYet they remain friends.\u201d \u201cHe found a worthy substitute. And, surfacely, she\u2019s a kind of redhead, too. If he follows his family pattern, he\u2019ll want to be married around thirty, and to a white woman, or at least not obviously mixed race. He\u2019ll expect to have a child within two or three years, and for the woman to take leave from her work and serve as professional mother for at least the first five years after that. \u201cIt\u2019s like a template,\u201d Eve added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty rigid. Those who deviate tend to drift away.\u201d \u201cThen why kill Erin?\u201d Mira lifted a hand, turned it palm up. \u201cHe has Becca to suit his lifestyle.\u201d \u201cShauna was his\u2014half of the whole. He may want her back, I\u2019m not sure about that, but she was his, then she wasn\u2019t. Like with Lopez, her relationship with Erin might have triggered feelings. It was one thing, at least acceptable, since he had Becca, for Shauna to sleep with attractive men. But she deviated from the template.\u201d \u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d \u201cYeah, has to be Albright\u2014manipulating, using, and so on. Not half of the famous Shaunbar. He manages. Not just the men\u2019s store, but people. And Shauna moves out of that scope\u2014she can\u2019t be managed when she\u2019s marrying someone who doesn\u2019t fit the pattern. And what about the years they were together? What does it say about that, about him?\u201d \u201cTo him? She\u2019s made a terrible mistake. She\u2019ll not only ruin her life, but smear their history together. Diminish it\u2014and him. It\u2019s very personal, as the murder was very personal.\u201d Eve set the tea aside, then pulled out her \u2019link. She cued up the recording to the smirk. \u201cThis is him, right as Lopez slapped Hunnicut.\u201d Mira took the \u2019link, studied the screen. \u201cAn unguarded instant. A mean, satisfied smile. A derisive smirk. An approval of Hunnicut\u2019s comeuppance. His feelings for Hunnicut are very complicated, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Mira handed back the \u2019link. \u201cHe needs and holds on to what they were together, the glossy couple admired, envied, even revered by their peers. I believe he may have genuinely enjoyed their friendship\u2014with him managing it\u2014while he cemented a relationship with the old schoolmate, and his former love\u2019s best friend.\u201d \u201cIt says I\u2019ve got someone, and\u2014during that time\u2014you don\u2019t. No one that sticks. Until Albright.\u201d \u201cUntil,\u201d Mira echoed. \u201cHe may have been somewhat amused initially, then appalled when it became clear the relationship was serious. Undoubtedly alarmed by the idea of marriage, a future, when he began to disrespect, at the least, the woman who\u2019d once been half of his whole due to what she became.\u201d \u201cAnd the last straw\u2014Maui,\u201d Eve added. \u201cHow could he allow Albright to fulfill that dream? More, how dare she try to? And she has the nerve to ask him to help her pull it off?\u201d \u201cYou conclude Erin needed to die\u2014the only clear way to stop the wedding, the mistake, the deviation. But Shauna had to be punished, had to suffer some consequences for her choices, for tainting what they\u2019d been to each other, what they\u2019d had together.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the nutshell.\u201d Now Mira set her tea aside. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree.\u201d \u201cI need more.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re taking the right direction in speaking to former classmates. So much of his persona is still tied there. You might dig up some former staff. Current may not wish to speak frankly about his attitudes on the job.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d \u201cAnd when you interview him, when you\u2019re ready to, make him angry.\u201d \u201cI have a knack for that.\u201d Mira\u2019s smile flashed, made her eyes sparkle. \u201cYou do. It\u2019s a gift. Insult that self-worth, the hidebound traditions, the high school hero status. You\u2019ll need to push for an unguarded moment, like that smirk. Pry that open? I\u2019d be very surprised if the rest doesn\u2019t fall.\u201d \u201cYou think he did it, too.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m reading your reports and notes, and you certainly lean there. So that\u2019s a factor. But I believe he\u2019s earned his place as your prime suspect.\u201d When Mira\u2019s personal \u2019link signaled, Eve started to rise. Mira gestured her down again as she took the \u2019link out of her jacket pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s Dennis. One second. Hello, Professor.\u201d \u201cDr. Mira.\u201d Just his voice had Eve going soft inside. She could see him in her mind\u2019s eye, the sweet face, the soft green eyes and mussed gray hair. \u201cSay hello to Eve. She\u2019s with me at the moment.\u201d \u201cHello, Eve. How are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d Not just soft, she had to admit, but a little bit gooey inside. \u201cI was just leaving.\u201d \u201cOh, not on my account. I just wanted to let Charlie know I fixed the leak.\u201d \u201cDid you?\u201d Mira\u2019s smile broke out again. \u201cYou\u2019re so clever, Dennis.\u201d \u201cNo more dripping, and no need for a plumber. And since it\u2019s a good night for grilling, I\u2019m marinating some ribs.\u201d \u201cThat sounds perfect. I should be home on time.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be here, waiting. We\u2019ll have some wine, won\u2019t we? I just have to find the corkscrew. It\u2019s never where I think it is.\u201d \u201cSecond drawer, right of the stovetop. See you soon.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s never soon enough. Goodbye, Eve, enjoy the rest of your day, and best to Roarke.\u201d \u201cBye,\u201d Eve murmured. Mira slipped the \u2019link away again. \u201cDennis gets a bit antsy toward the end of summer. He only teaches one class in the summer term. And he likes to think he\u2019s handy, with tools, around the house. Sometimes, surprisingly, he is. Other times?\u201d With a laugh, Mira rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, the chaos, the cursing. But the man\u2019s a genius with a marinade. It\u2019s lovely to know I\u2019ll go home to wine and a good meal.\u201d \u201cIt is.\u201d Roarke might not be a genius with marinade\u2014she didn\u2019t think either of them knew the first thing about marinade\u2014but he always made sure she had a good meal. \u201cI need to get back to it. Thanks for the time, and the insight.\u201d \u201cI think you had more than enough of your own in this case.\u201d \u201cIt helps to have some confirmation. I know he did it,\u201d she said as she rose. \u201cI know how he did it, and if I don\u2019t have all the why, I have most of it. Make him angry,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have a problem there.\u201d She started for the door, paused with her hand on the knob. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, being married.\u201d This time Mira simply beamed. \u201cYes, it is. The right life partner makes all the difference. Wasn\u2019t it clever of both of us to choose so well?\u201d \u201cI used to think I didn\u2019t choose so much as tripped into it.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t trip, Eve.\u201d \u201cWell, not very often.\u201d When she left, she got the gimlet eye from the admin that suggested she\u2019d gone over her allotted time. Probably had, she considered as she kept right on going. But it had been worth it. Former staff\u2014a good angle. Make him angry? She\u2019d have done that anyway, but it was a solid tip to do that as quickly as possible. When she walked back into Homicide, Jenkinson, his tie, and his partner were missing, as were Baxter and Trueheart. Santiago and Carmichael huddled at his desk. Eve hoped they consulted on a case and weren\u2019t making a bet that Santiago would surely lose. Peabody signaled her. \u201cJenkinson and Reineke caught one. Baxter and Trueheart are with a suspect in Interview A. And I talked to some former classmates. Actually three. Two were full of Shaunbar, and how Barney was such a star on the field and an inspiration otherwise. But then I got an earful from a \u2026 Julian Prowder.\u201d \u201cFill my ear.\u201d \u201cOkay. He was careful at first. High school, who remembers, who cares. But then it turned out he remembered a lot and cared a bunch more. Let\u2019s see.\u201d She pulled her notes, though Eve could tell she didn\u2019t need them. \u201cPuffed-up prick, stuck-up jerk with a stick up his ass. More than happy to narc on a fellow student for any infraction, but kept it down-low. Any guy who so much as looked at Shauna too close became a prime target for just that. He said Barney would wait and watch for a misstep, then pounce. \u201cApparently Prowder wasn\u2019t among the best dressed in that era\u2014family of three boys, and he was the youngest. So hand-me-down time. He said Barney liked to sneer and snark at him about his clothes, but again, down-low because he liked to pretend he was above the fray. And Shauna wasn\u2019t one for snarking that way.\u201d \u201cA different perspective. Keep at it. I\u2019m going to dig up former employees at the men\u2019s shop. Let\u2019s see what they think about Barney\u2019s managerial style.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good one.\u201d \u201cMore Mira\u2019s than mine, but yeah.\u201d Then, she decided as she went to her office, she\u2019d take another page from Feeney. She\u2019d put in some thinking time. It took her awhile, but when she found one\u2014a LeRoy Vic\u2014she hit gold. \u201cYeah, I can talk about Greg Barney, the fuck.\u201d Vic, age thirty-five, mixed race, sun-streaked brown hair, scowled on-screen. \u201cI had an opportunity for a manager\u2019s position at Orlando\u2019s in Brooklyn. My wife was having a baby, and we wanted to move there to be closer to our families. It would\u2019ve been a step up for me\u2014a solid raise. I worked five years at On Trend, the last two as assistant manager under that prick. And what does he do? He gives me a crap eval. How my work ethic declined, I\u2019ve taken too much time off, my customer service tended to be shoddy.\u201d \u201cYou disagree with that evaluation?\u201d \u201cDamn right. I always covered for Greg, or anybody, when they needed some time. Did I take some time, too? Sure. My wife had a real shaky first trimester, and she needed me. I had the time coming, and I took it. But my work was never, ever shoddy, and I had top sales six months running.\u201d \u201cCan you speculate why his evaluation was so poor?\u201d \u201cI can tell you why. He didn\u2019t want me to get the job. I wouldn\u2019t have known about the eval, but the outgoing manager at Orlando\u2019s told me. He said how I\u2019d aced the interview and so on, so I confronted Greg about it, and he said, like he\u2019s my keeper or something, how it was for my own good. How I couldn\u2019t handle that job, and was making a mistake taking on the responsibility when I had a kid coming.\u201d \u201cI see. What did you do about it?\u201d \u201cI wanted to quit, but my wife talked me out of it. And she was right. What I did? I made copies of my sales records, and I contacted some of my regulars, asked for references. And I got them. I got passed over for the manager\u2019s slot, but I got a sales position, and I took it. Then I quit. \u201cThat was two years ago. I\u2019m manager now, so Greg Barney can kiss my ass. He had no right, no fucking right to do that, to decide what was best for me and my family. But he\u2019s the type who always thinks he knows best.\u201d \u201cI appreciate your input.\u201d \u201cYou ought to talk to Sharlene Wilson. She was in sales, and he pushed her out. Maybe a year and a half ago.\u201d \u201cWould you have her contact?\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t talked to her in a few months, but yeah. Give me a second.\u201d Muttering to himself about Barney\u2014asshole, prick, bullshit eval\u2014he dug it up, gave it to Eve. \u201cSo, what did he do?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just gathering information in an ongoing investigation.\u201d \u201cWell, I hope whatever it is, I read about it. Shoddy customer service, my ass.\u201d \u201cThanks for your time, Mr. Vic.\u201d \u201cNo problem.\u201d She contacted Sharlene Wilson, left a voice mail. Then she put her boots up, closed her eyes. And took the thinking time. Peabody said, \u201cUm.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m thinking.\u201d Though Eve had heard her coming, she stayed another moment as she was. \u201cI reached Barney\u2019s former assistant manager, and have a voice mail into another former clerk. The former assistant manager shares your former classmate\u2019s opinion of Greg Barney.\u201d Eve pointed to the AC, then opened her eyes. As Peabody programmed coffee, she relayed LeRoy Vic\u2019s statement. \u201cThat\u2019s a crappy thing to do.\u201d \u201cIt is, but more, it fits the \u2018I\u2019m going to screw up your life for your own good\u2019 routine.\u201d \u201cI hit another who said he got the shit kicked out of him in high school, not by Barney, but because of him.\u201d With her coffee, Peabody eased very, very carefully onto the ass-biting visitor\u2019s chair. \u201cOne of Barney\u2019s teammates got suspended\u2014from school and the team\u2014when someone reported he had a couple Zoner joints in his locker. Since the teammate was going hard after Barney\u2019s team captain position, the guy figured Barney for the squealer, but Barney claimed he actually saw the other kid heading into the vice principal\u2019s office right before the teammate was called down and suspended.\u201d Peabody shifted, again very, very carefully. \u201cYou have to figure the guy\u2019s got no reason to lie about it now. He says he never went to the vice principal, never said a damn thing, but got his ass kicked over it anyway. He figures Barney turned it on him because his locker was next to Zoner Guy\u2019s and he was a member of the Clean Teens Club. They take an oath not to use illegals or drink alcohol, to eat only plant-based foods and abstain from sex.\u201d Eve glanced up from her coffee. \u201cSeriously?\u201d \u201cI take it it\u2019s a pretty small club. Anyway, when Zoner Guy jumped Mr. Clean Teen\u2014you\u2019re going to like this\u2014he said Barney saw it go down. And he smirked.\u201d \u201cI bet he did. Oh yeah, he did. Gets rid of competition, covers his own ass, and gets to watch someone he probably considered an annoyance get tuned up.\u201d Eve looked at the board, looked at Barney\u2019s easy, attractive smile. \u201cYou know, he\u2019d have lived his life smoothly bullying and manipulating\u2014a general asshole who\u2019d probably have carved out the life he wanted. But then Shauna had to fall for someone he didn\u2019t approve of\u2014and couldn\u2019t be smoothly manipulated out of it. So he turned to murder. He\u2019d feel justified,\u201d she added. \u201cIn all cases, he\u2019d feel justified.\u201d She lifted her mug toward the board. \u201cWe\u2019re going to nail his ass, Peabody.\u201d \u201cI like to think so, but up till now the only real evidence we have, and that\u2019s still circumstantial, is he\u2019s an asshole.\u201d \u201cNext step.\u201d Thinking time had given her that. \u201cWe go through the victim\u2019s apartment again. With Shauna. Barney took something out with him in that damn box. She\u2019s the only one who\u2019d know what\u2019s missing.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s going to be touchy.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll stand up to it.\u201d Eve remembered the punch, the damn good punch. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hit her with it today. Not only too emotional, but she\u2019ll have too many people around her today. But tomorrow. You have to figure her friends need to go back to work\u2014they can\u2019t surround her all day. So tomorrow, we go by where she\u2019s staying and convince her to go through the apartment with us.\u201d \u201cOkay, but if he took something she didn\u2019t even know was there\u2014\u201d \u201cShe will. It\u2019s personal. Something he wanted for himself, or wanted back, or maybe some sort of trophy. It mattered to him enough to take it. If she notices later, well, it got lost in all the confusion, so sorry.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot, but even with that\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the next step,\u201d Eve interrupted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to lead to the one after. He\u2019s slick, Peabody. A first kill, yes, but he\u2019s been honing his skills in manipulation, ass-covering, that smooth bullying his whole life, so he\u2019s slick. We\u2019re slicker.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d drink to that if I hadn\u2019t already finished my coffee.\u201d \u201cGo contact Shauna\u2014you\u2019re just checking on her, letting her know we charged Lopez with assault. Lay on the sympathy and find out if she\u2019s still at Decker\u2019s for the next few days, blah blah. How you guess her friends have to get back to work. Don\u2019t mention tomorrow.\u201d \u201cGot it. Just confirm where she\u2019ll be, and if she\u2019ll be on her own.\u201d \u201cThen dig more into high school. I\u2019ll start on college. Let\u2019s build ourselves a pattern, Peabody. A profile of an asshole.\u201d \u201cYou know, there are a lot of assholes in the world. Most of them don\u2019t kill people over bullshit.\u201d Eve glanced back at the board. \u201cThis one did.\u201d She gave it another hour, then ninety minutes when Sharlene Wilson tagged her back. Deciding her ears were full enough, for now, she called it. She walked into the bullpen just as Baxter rose from his desk. A glance at the bullpen case board told her he and Trueheart had closed their current case. \u201cWrapped it?\u201d she said. \u201cIn a bright, shiny bow. My esteemed partner and I are heading out for a celebrational brew. We just sent you the paperwork.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take a look from home.\u201d \u201cWrapped ours, too,\u201d Santiago said from his desk as he continued to work his comp. \u201cJust finishing up the eights. I\u2019m in for a celebrational brew. Carmichael?\u201d \u201cTwist my well-toned arm. Reineke?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the ME on ours. Gonna be accidental. Guy weighs in easy four-fifty. Decides he\u2019s going to sweat off the pounds and buys himself one of those hot boxes.\u201d \u201cHot boxes?\u201d \u201cSome fad, Loo,\u201d Jenkinson told her. \u201cYou buy this kit, put this box together with a temp control deal. Supposed to get a certified tech to do it, but this guy does it himself, puts on the suit that comes with it, goes in. Ends up baking himself, can\u2019t get out. Kit\u2019s got a fail-safe so it shuts off after like thirty minutes, but he didn\u2019t bother with that. So baked.\u201d \u201cWell, that sounds \u2026 ugly.\u201d \u201cSure as hell was,\u201d Reineke confirmed. \u201cI can meet you for one brew\u2014I got time for one\u2014after we clear this.\u201d \u201cI got a family thing,\u201d Jenkinson said. \u201cCatch one next time.\u201d \u201cHow about it, Peabody, Dallas?\u201d Eve shook her head at Baxter. \u201cWe didn\u2019t close ours. I\u2019ve got work to do at home. Peabody, go home or go catch a brew.\u201d \u201cThe Blue Line?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ll see if McNab\u2019s up for it, meet you if he is. Shauna\u2019s still at Decker\u2019s, Dallas, and everyone\u2019s got work tomorrow. She should be alone by nine-thirty.\u201d \u201cThen we\u2019ll go by after nine-thirty.\u201d \u201cI got a couple more statements.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll read them at home. Take off. Good work,\u201d she added to the rest of the squad, and headed out. She could see the steps toward closing out the case. But until that first step, the rest continued as speculation. Right now, she wanted home. Some quiet. Some mind-clearing time. A stupid murder, she thought, and found that single point infuriated her. Selfish, ugly, cruel, but she expected those elements in any murder. The stupidity of the motivation stuck in her craw. And not over a high school girlfriend, she thought as she pushed through traffic. Not that, not really. It was more, and it was deeper than that. It came down to the need to direct others\u2019 choices, to open or block the life path of people connected to him. An ordinary man, really, an average sort of guy with an average sort of background, income, lifestyle. Nothing particularly dark, nothing especially brilliant. But in his way, he\u2019d decided he was qualified to play God. He decided what suited, what didn\u2019t. And in Erin Albright\u2019s case, who lived, who died. Her advantage wasn\u2019t just that she knew it all, was as sure of it all as she\u2019d been about any investigation in her career, but that Barney surely believed he\u2019d gotten away with it. She hoped by this time tomorrow, he\u2019d learn differently. As she swung through the gates, she felt her shoulders relax. Just that easy, she realized. All it took was the sight of that castle-like house rising on that green ocean of lawn, the wild late summer blooms, the glint of window glass in the evening sun. She\u2019d update her board and her book, then maybe have that glass of wine with Roarke. Talk the whole thing over with him. Share a good meal, then maybe try to work some new angles, as the talking-things-over part often gave her that potential. She parked, and didn\u2019t let the knowledge she\u2019d need to go through the gamut of Summerset spoil the homecoming. He loomed, of course, with his greeting partner Galahad beside him in the foyer where the cool air smelled, very subtly, of summer flowers. \u201cYeah, yeah, I know,\u201d she began. \u201cNo blood again. Must be a record, since the anal keep track.\u201d \u201cCongratulations.\u201d He spoke dryly. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to mark it down on my event calendar. Roarke is upstairs in his office. He had a difficult day.\u201d She\u2019d bent down to stroke the cat, and looked up, straightened. As alarm bells rang in her head. \u201cIs he hurt?\u201d \u201cNot physically, no. He\u2019s brooding, which he\u2019s quite good at from time to time. I expect you\u2019ll deal with it. If not, I can cancel my plans for this evening.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d She started for the stairs. \u201cFish and chips,\u201d Summerset added. \u201cIt\u2019s a comfort food for him.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d She went up the stairs with the cat on her heels. He didn\u2019t often need comfort, she thought. But she could figure it out. Upstairs, she heard his voice\u2014sharp and final, with a little more Irish leading the way. A sure sign of emotion\u2014passion, anger, amusement. And in this case, anger. \u201cI said it\u2019s done, and handled as I choose. That\u2019s the bloody end of it.\u201d She turned into the office just as he cut off whoever had been on the other end of the \u2019link. He sat, hair tied back, jacket off, sleeves rolled. Work mode, she noted. But the cold blue fire in his eyes went dark and broody. Dark and broody enough he didn\u2019t sense her there. The cat trotted over, leaped onto the desk. \u201cNot now, mate. Not now.\u201d He started to lift the cat off, then spotted Eve. \u201cAh. I didn\u2019t know you were home.\u201d \u201cJust got here. So, what was that about? On the \u2019link just now?\u201d \u201cNothing.\u201d He shrugged it off as he set the cat on the floor. \u201cA work matter. It\u2019s handled. But I have a bit more to see to here.\u201d Oh no, she thought, he didn\u2019t get off that easy. \u201cWhat kind of work matter?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s handled,\u201d he repeated, and though the tone lacked the sharpness, it still held all the finality. It clearly said: Butt out. The tone would\u2019ve pissed her off\u2014if she hadn\u2019t seen the brooding under the temper. But she knew how to light the match. \u201cWhen my work matters put me in a mood, you want to know why.\u201d \u201cYour moods are many,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not at all the same.\u201d Okay, sometimes dealing with it meant pushing for a fight to burn off the brood, more with a torch than a match. \u201cOh, because your work\u2019s so important and beyond my limited scope with me just being a cop and you being the great and powerful Roarke.\u201d \u201cNow she quotes from classic vids.\u201d He shoved up. It wasn\u2019t the icy fire in his eyes but all heat. \u201cI asked a simple question,\u201d she tossed back. \u201cInstead of a simple answer, you lob insults.\u201d \u201cI stated a simple fact, but take it as you will. Now, for feck\u2019s sake, give me a bit of time. Christ knows I give you all you need there. Go deal with your board and scour your daily notes, and leave me to this.\u201d She said, simply, \u201cNo.\u201d The cat, who\u2019d watched the exchange, decided to desert the field and jogged out the office door as Roarke rounded on her. \u201cThis is my bloody space, for my bleeding business, so move on to yours. This has nothing to do with you, so go see to your own.\u201d \u201cYou are my own.\u201d With that, she watched the anger drain out of him as if she\u2019d turned a tap. \u201cAh, fuck it all.\u201d When he dragged a hand through his hair, when it wasn\u2019t ice, or fire, or brooding in his eyes, but desolation, she stepped to him. Put her arms around him. \u201cTell me.\u201d He lowered his forehead to hers. \u201cI had to fire someone today, someone who\u2019s worked for me a decade.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cYou know her a bit, I\u2019d think. Alyce Avery.\u201d Eve did a quick run through her mental files. \u201cOkay, yeah, she\u2019s been to the holiday parties. Why did you have to fire her?\u201d \u201cShe stole from me\u2014which is a haughty ledge for a thief to stand on.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u2014and former,\u201d she reminded him, laying a hand on his cheek. \u201cAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, she tried to throw the blame on someone else to save herself. She could\u2019ve come to me.\u201d He drew away to pace to the window and stare out. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she come to me when she found herself in a squeeze?\u201d \u201cWhat squeeze?\u201d \u201cAll that came out, didn\u2019t it, too late. Her son started gambling and got into considerable debt to the wrong sort. So she skimmed and shuffled\u2014of course, intending to pay it all back. And when the skimming and shuffling came out, she tried to blame her assistant, which only made it that much worse, didn\u2019t it?\u201d He turned back. \u201cI\u2019d have helped her, but she broke trust between us, and would\u2019ve let someone innocent pay the price. So now her life\u2019s in shambles.\u201d \u201cAre you pressing charges?\u201d The ice came back. \u201cShe\u2019ll pay it back. She\u2019ll have time, but she\u2019ll pay every penny back. That\u2019s my decision, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cSo the cop doesn\u2019t point out she broke the law?\u201d \u201cNo. Your wife points out you did what you had to do by firing her, and what you needed to do by giving her time to pay it back. And the son?\u201d \u201cI had a word with him as well. I used the threat of his mother going to prison for embezzlement as motivation for him to enter rehab for gambling addiction. Likely not the way, but\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one way, especially if you were Scary Roarke.\u201d He smiled, just a little. \u201cI suppose I was at that. I was fair pissed enough to be. Others don\u2019t fully agree with my decision.\u201d \u201cOthers aren\u2019t the boss of you. If it counts, I agree with it.\u201d \u201cIt counts a great deal. Bugger it. It counts a very great deal. And I\u2019m sorry for my vicious mood and slapping at you when you offered to listen.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not the only one whose moods are many.\u201d He smiled again, just a little more. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re not. I love you, Eve.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I love you back. Enough that I\u2019m going to take care of dinner, which we\u2019re going to eat on the patio. It\u2019s cooled off enough, and we could both use it.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a very fine idea. Thanks for it.\u201d \n Chapter Twenty-one She changed into a breezy tank and shorts, and he into a T-shirt and casual pants. The August heat lurked under a sluggish breeze, but that, Eve decided, was summer. The patio pots and planters appeared to agree, as they stood lush with color and scent while the sky held a bold and arrogant summer blue. She figured if the alternative had been starving to death, she could figure out the grill. But under the circumstances, she took Summerset\u2019s advice. She set out fish and chips, added some brown bread and butter, and switched out wine for Guinness. Roarke took one look at the patio table and kissed her cheek. \u201cWell now, this is perfect, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He sat, lifted his glass to her. \u201cHere\u2019s to you for knowing when and how to piss me off.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a skill.\u201d She took his hand, squeezed it before she lifted her own glass. \u201cAnd you\u2019re smart enough to know, when your head\u2019s clear again, you did her and her son a favor.\u201d \u201cA favor, is it?\u201d \u201cYou could\u2019ve pressed charges, or you could have kept her on\u2014made her pay the money back, but kept her on. You\u2019d have considered both.\u201d \u201cI did, yes.\u201d \u201cBut neither of those would\u2019ve helped her, or her son. In her case, doing time wouldn\u2019t have accomplished much, and keeping her on? You\u2019d never have trusted her again, and she\u2019d know it. So she starts over from now. She fucked up and has to deal with the fallout.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s a favor to her?\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to deal with the fallout, it\u2019s real easy to fuck up again, and it gets easier to fuck up on purpose, because why not?\u201d With a shrug, she rained salt on her chips. \u201cShe worked for you for a decade, you invited her into your home, so she\u2019s not an idiot or a career criminal. She\u2019ll remember what she did every time she makes a payment back to you. And unless the son\u2019s a complete dick, he\u2019ll remember how his actions affected his mother, which may\u2014just may\u2014help the rehab stick.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not an idiot, no, and hardly one to make a career out of embezzlement. And rather than a complete dick, her son\u2019s young and foolish. Barely into his twenties, and if I\u2019m a judge, sick at heart at what that foolishness cost his mother.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a damn good judge.\u201d \u201cShe raised him on her own\u2014the father was out of the picture when I hired her. They\u2019re very close, so while I can\u2019t quite see the favor in it, I think they\u2019ll come around after a time. \u201cIn any case, a brutal day, and I\u2019m grateful to you for taking the edge off it.\u201d Steam pumped out of the fish when she forked into it, and smelled pretty damn good. \u201cI got to needle you, so that\u2019s a side benefit for me. Other than getting knocked on my ass by a piss-soaked junkie, it\u2019s about the only action I saw today.\u201d \u201cAnd how did a piss-soaked junkie knock you on your ass?\u201d \u201cCouple of rooks hauled him into the elevator, which means I\u2019m getting off because piss-soaked, and they let him slip. He rammed right into me. Jesus, the smell. I\u2019m lucky it didn\u2019t have time to transfer.\u201d \u201cYou meet such interesting people in the course of your day. And the memorial?\u201d It would take his mind off the brutal, Eve decided. \u201cI guess the highlight would be when Hunnicut\u2019s up there talking about Albright\u2014heartfelt, touching\u2014and Lopez comes in. Not altogether drunk, but definitely lit.\u201d She ran it through\u2014rant, slap, punch. \u201cI suppose that livened things up, so to speak.\u201d \u201cShock, horror, fascination.\u201d \u201cAnd gave you a chance to take on Lopez in the box, I assume.\u201d \u201cOh yeah.\u201d She ran it through for him as they ate, and yes, she could see it took his mind off his own day. \u201cYou don\u2019t think she killed Erin Albright.\u201d \u201cNo. Do you?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s impulsive, careless of others, hotheaded. And no. A moment\u2019s heat, an angry strike, then yes. But not the way this was done. It\u2019s far too cool and calculating.\u201d \u201cSee, a good judge.\u201d She pulled her \u2019link out of her pocket. \u201cJudge this. Greg Barney between slap and punch.\u201d Roarke took the \u2019link, studied the screen. He looked at Eve and said, \u201cAh.\u201d \u201cYeah, ah.\u201d After pocketing the \u2019link again, she ate more chips. \u201cThat\u2019s not the expression of a man, Mr. Nice Guy, watching his good friend and former sweetheart get clocked at her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s memorial.\u201d \u201cSo he\u2019s your man.\u201d \u201cOh, he is. With any luck, I\u2019ll have him in the box tomorrow, and then in a cage.\u201d \u201cWhat else do you have?\u201d That single question, she had to admit, centered the problem. \u201cMy gut, mostly, and personality. A kind of profile of an asshole.\u201d She ran her day through for him as that day waned with softening light and quiet breezes. \u201cThe last one I talked to, just before I left Central, worked under him at the shop. A woman, early forties, married, two kids. She worked there part-time, and said he made a habit of saying how she\u2019d make more as a professional mother, and how much better off her kids would be if she stayed home.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s another ah from me.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019d say how she liked working, being out in the world, and her kids were fine. It irritated her some, but she didn\u2019t think much of it. He also wondered, out loud, why she wanted to work in a men\u2019s shop. Wouldn\u2019t she be more comfortable, if she insisted on working, putting in her time at a woman\u2019s boutique\u2014shit like that.\u201d She took the bread, slathered with butter, that Roarke offered, bit in. \u201cAfter a while, he started cutting her hours. Hired another part-timer\u2014a man, naturally. She took off for a school function, with advance notice\u2014but he wrote her up for it. Just continued to undermine her in little ways, claimed some customers complained about her attitude, her service, which she said was bullshit. And I believe her on that. \u201cEventually, she quit\u2014decided it wasn\u2019t worth the annoyance of dealing with him. And get this, he told her she was making the right choice for her family.\u201d \u201cMore than a bit of a prick, isn\u2019t he then? And calculating.\u201d \u201cExactly. He takes his time, maneuvers and manipulates. No problem lying to get his way, or using his position as a supervisor to bully staff. Because in his world, he\u2019s right, he knows best.\u201d \u201cAnd if Shauna\u2014whom he\u2019d consider part of his world\u2014won\u2019t do what\u2019s best for her, won\u2019t live as he believes she should and must, well then, he\u2019ll simply remove the impediment. And she\u2019ll need to deal with the results of her poor choices, won\u2019t she? A dead love, a broken dream, a slap in the face.\u201d Sipping her beer, Eve smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s nice eating fish and chips with someone who sees it like I do.\u201d \u201cI can certainly see why you don\u2019t like him on a personal level, and I can see why you do like him as Albright\u2019s killer. Why don\u2019t you help me see how you intend to get him into the box, then into a cage?\u201d \u201cI can do that. Why don\u2019t we deal with these dishes, then I\u2019ll do that while we take a walk.\u201d Now he reached for her hand. \u201cDarling Eve. Are you making time for me?\u201d \u201cFor us. A few things\u2014not case related. Did you know you\u2019re supposed to marinate ribs?\u201d \u201cWhose ribs?\u201d She laughed, and polished off her beer. \u201cThe kind you eat smothered in barbecue sauce if you\u2019ve got any sense.\u201d \u201cIn that case, I didn\u2019t, no. Why?\u201d \u201cMr. Mira called when I was consulting with Mira. Apparently he fixed a leaky faucet or pipe or something.\u201d Considering him, she frowned. \u201cCould you do that?\u201d \u201cI could, actually, and have done.\u201d \u201cGood to know. During their brief conversation, he said he was marinating ribs, and they\u2019d have wine if he could find the corkscrew. You know how he is.\u201d \u201cI do. Charming and wise.\u201d \u201cYeah, he is. She told him where to find it, and it struck me like it did this morning. It\u2019s nice being married. So it\u2019s good to make time when we can. \u201cThen, as I\u2019m about to leave Central, Baxter tells me he and Trueheart just closed one, and are heading out for a brew. Santiago and Carmichael are finishing up the paperwork on another, and are going to join. Jenkinson and Reineke are waiting for an ME report, and Reineke will meet them because Jenkinson has a family thing. Peabody\u2019s going to see if McNab\u2019s up for it. So they\u2019ll go hang some at the Blue Line, have a brew.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to join them?\u201d \u201cWork on my mind.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cAnd I just wanted to get home. But it made me think about the idea of Off Duty, and how it\u2019ll be good to have another place. Maybe you want more than a fake burger and a half-decent brew. Maybe you want some music and more variety after closing one, or when you\u2019ve got a hard one and need a break.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s coming along well.\u201d \u201cAlso good to know.\u201d She rose. \u201cLet\u2019s get this stuff out of the way.\u201d It felt good, that walk, as the sun slipped lower and some crazed bird sang to oncoming twilight. In the grove, peaches hung like rosy balls just waiting to be plucked. Roarke did just that, handed it to her. The first bite, so sweet, so fresh, had her taking another. \u201cGod, that\u2019s ridiculous. Nothing should taste that amazing.\u201d \u201cWhen I had them planted, years ago, I wanted the look and scent of them. As well as the magic Summerset can make with them. I never imagined walking here with you, enjoying them right off the branch.\u201d \u201cI sure as hell never saw myself eating a peach, or anything else, right off the tree.\u201d Since she was, she took another bite. \u201cI\u2019d never even seen a peach tree before these. Can you grow one from the seed or whatever it is?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a pit, and I suppose. How else would they get them?\u201d \u201cHow the hell would I know? Peabody would. We should give her some.\u201d \u201cPeaches or pits?\u201d \u201cWell, if we give her some peaches, she\u2019d have both.\u201d \u201cA fine idea. I\u2019ll see to it. Now. The box and the cage?\u201d \u201cBarney took something from that apartment. I knew it at the time\u2014nothing I could do about it, but I knew it. I\u2019m more sure of it now. It fits his pattern, his profile.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of thing, do you think?\u201d \u201cSee, that\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been playing with. Nothing big, nothing anyone else would notice. Family and a couple other friends have been in there getting things for Hunnicut, taking Albright\u2019s clothes and stuff, so nothing that stands out.\u201d \u201cSomething tucked away then.\u201d She pointed at him with what was left of her peach. \u201cSee that? That\u2019s cop thinking, and you just have to swallow it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t at all, because it\u2019s thief thinking as well. And there I have the foundation.\u201d \u201cWell, maybe.\u201d She\u2019d allow it, she decided as they strolled toward the pond. \u201cBut even tucked away, not really something people would notice right off. They\u2019re bringing clothes and so on to her. And she was wearing earrings at the memorial. Not the ones she had on the night of the party, so someone brought those to her.\u201d \u201cSeems like something more between the two of them\u2014Hunnicut and Barney.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the most sense. Something he wanted back because she didn\u2019t deserve it now. Maybe something he gave her at some point. And probably when they were a couple. That\u2019s what it feels like to me. \u201c\u2018I gave you this when you were perfect, and now you\u2019re not. You can\u2019t keep it.\u2019\u201d She sat on the bench by the pond, looked at the floating lilies. The tree with the flowing branches she and Roarke had planted seemed to have grown some. That struck her as an accidental triumph. \u201cI could be off there. Could be something else. A note he wrote her, a photograph. Maybe even something Albright gave her that burned his narrow-minded ass. Maybe something to do with the wedding the others hadn\u2019t removed yet.\u201d She tossed the peach pit. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a kick in the ass if it grew a tree there?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d say more a minor miracle.\u201d They sat a moment, enjoying the evening, the shine of the water as the sun dipped lower yet, the spread of the plants around the pond. The worst edges of his day worn away, he laid a hand over hers. \u201cAnd how will you know what he took?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the sticky part. I have to convince Hunnicut\u2014push her if it comes down to it\u2014to go back to the apartment with me and Peabody. She hasn\u2019t been back since the murder, and she\u2019s made it clear she won\u2019t. But I have to get her to not only go back, but go through the place. To look in closets, in cupboards, in drawers. Then make absolutely sure she keeps her mouth shut about it.\u201d Eve let out a breath. \u201cShe\u2019s used to sharing. It\u2019s her nature to tell things to her friends, her family. Possibly complete strangers. So the trick is, go back where she\u2019s staying in the morning, when we can be reasonably sure she\u2019s alone. Then convince her to go back, go through, and tell no one.\u201d \u201cShe loved Albright. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be as sticky as you imagine to convince her to do this if she believes it will help.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s also used to trusting.\u201d As day slipped toward dusk, Eve tipped her head to Roarke\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI have to make her trust me more than she does her tribe.\u201d \u201cShe may not, but she\u2019ll respect your authority. She\u2019s a rule follower, isn\u2019t she? Wouldn\u2019t that be one of the reasons, besides her looks, why Barney was attracted to her, attached himself to her?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right about that. Hunnicut broke one of his rules, so she had to pay for it.\u201d \u201cHow will that help you, if you find what he took?\u201d \u201cBy getting a search warrant for his place, finding what he took, charging him with theft, getting him into the box on it, then pushing the right buttons. I\u2019m going to make it work. You took the edge off my day, too.\u201d \u201cDid it have one?\u201d \u201cMostly the edge of frustration. I know he did it, I know where to find him. I know how he did it\u2014or close enough. Why, or close enough. But I can\u2019t just knock on his door and cuff him.\u201d \u201cBut you like a challenge, Lieutenant.\u201d \u201cI guess I do. He\u2019s such a weak asshole, Roarke, the motive is so idiotic, it annoys me. He\u2019s so not worth it.\u201d \u201cSo you remember Erin Albright is.\u201d God, he understood her. \u201cSo I remember Erin Albright is. It\u2019s small, annoying steps instead of a big takedown. But she\u2019s worth it.\u201d She lifted her head, looked at him. \u201cI forgot. I bought that painting\u2014or will.\u201d \u201cYour first slice of New York.\u201d \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll like having it for that. And to remind me that sometimes it takes a lot of small, annoying steps. I need to go in, take some more of them.\u201d \u201cAll right.\u201d \u201cIn a minute.\u201d She lowered her head to his shoulder again. \u201cJust one more minute. I feel sorry for people who don\u2019t have a spot like this\u2014not the big grand scope of all this. Just a quiet spot where they can sit, with someone who matters or alone, and smooth out the edges of the day.\u201d She slid her hand into his, linked fingers. \u201cI never imagined this, any more than eating a peach off the tree.\u201d \u201cWe planted that one there.\u201d \u201cSure as hell did. It\u2019s growing, right? It looks like it is to me.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s growing.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI suppose so are we.\u201d They went back in, and up to Eve\u2019s office, where the cat lay sprawled in her sleep chair. He eyed them both as if to determine the need to retreat again. Sensing the crisis had passed, he stretched, rolled, and sprawled in a different direction. \u201cDo you really have work to deal with?\u201d Eve asked Roarke. \u201cNot really, no. I can get quite a bit done when pissed off, and did.\u201d \u201cDo you want an assignment?\u201d He slid a hand into his pocket, fingered the gray button. \u201cWill I enjoy it?\u201d \u201cYou tell me. The first is to take a good look at Becca DiNuzio\u2019s family. I want to see how they fit in Barney\u2019s narrow worldview. The next is to check and see if Barney\u2019s insured any paintings since the murder. He\u2019d have had time now if he thought to. And last, to look at his finances again.\u201d \u201cThere now, we\u2019re getting to the enjoyment.\u201d \u201cCan you dig down into purchases, gift-type things, specifically for women? Girlfriend gift\u2013type things, in the last three years.\u201d \u201cAh, you want to see what he might buy for DiNuzio, as it may lead you to what he might have bought back in the day for Hunnicut. And taken back.\u201d \u201cYeah. I want to see if he considers Becca\u2014and her family\u2014worthy enough, and if so, what he buys his girlfriend.\u201d \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll enjoy that. Not such a small step, I\u2019m thinking, as it may save you several others.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the goal.\u201d While he went into his office, she updated her board. Then set it aside to read over the paperwork from her other detectives, signed off. Good work there, she thought, all around. Now it was her turn, so she programmed coffee and settled into it. When Roarke came back, she frowned at him. \u201cThat didn\u2019t take long. No luck?\u201d \u201cHow easily you doubt me. First.\u201d He sat on the edge of her command center, drank what was left of her second cup of coffee. \u201cDiNuzio\u2019s parents have been married thirty-one years. To each other. She\u2019s the oldest of three\u2014I assume you ran her before so know the basics. Her mother\u2019s a mathematician, and took parental leave for each offspring. The father, an engineer, coached her younger brother\u2019s softball team. They\u2019ve lived in the same house, the same neighborhood, for twenty-six years.\u201d \u201cPotentially worthy then, on his scale.\u201d \u201cAnd your instinct continues. He insured a painting, an Albright, only this morning, valued at forty-eight hundred. As for gifts, he strikes me as, again, very stagnant and very ordinary. Cross-reference DiNuzio\u2019s birthday, his mother\u2019s, his sisters\u2019 and it\u2019s easy to find. His mother, his sisters, a sweater, a scarf, that sort of thing. A girlfriend gets jewelry. The same holds for what I\u2019d assume is Christmas, and as the date range matches for the last three years, what would likely be an anniversary. Add Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d \u201cJewelry.\u201d \u201cHe tosses in a few other items for Christmas, but jewelry, yes, is the main thing. Nothing overly expensive, but not too cheap, either. He frequents the same jeweler on Fifth, or has for these purchases. Earrings are his go-to, but he\u2019s gone for a necklace, a bracelet now and then.\u201d \u201cShe wore this necklace, linked hearts, played with it some in Interview.\u201d \u201cLinked hearts\u2014a boyfriend gift, I\u2019d say. And for her birthday last spring, a ring. Not an engagement type. A blue topaz flanked by citrines. A blue stone,\u201d he explained, \u201cwith smaller yellow ones on each side. Set in silver.\u201d \u201cYeah, I got it. She\u2019s had it on every time I\u2019ve seen her. Okay, okay, it\u2019s jewelry. And it\u2019s probably jewelry he took.\u201d She pushed up, paced. \u201cShauna got engaged. He\u2019s not ready for that yet, but he switches up and gives Becca a ring. Symbolic, maybe. It\u2019s always jewelry, so we\u2019ll try that first tomorrow. He\u2019s got a pattern, he has tradition. This makes sense. Thanks.\u201d She glanced back at her command center where he sat still, looking so easily Roarke. Her coffee was gone, and she had nothing to do, not really, until the next morning. As if reading her, he got up, slid his arms around her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut this down, and we go for a swim? We can smooth out the rest of each other\u2019s edges.\u201d \u201cYou just want to get me wet and naked.\u201d \u201cI absolutely do.\u201d He kissed her, slow, long, deep, to prove it. \u201cSince that means I get you wet and naked, too, what are we waiting for? Close operations,\u201d she said, and kissed him back. She woke in the morning with everything as smooth as it got. And there, on the sofa, sat Roarke and the cat, so she began a day as well as she\u2019d ended another. She rolled out of bed and went straight for coffee. \u201cI\u2019m so ready for today.\u201d \u201cBe ready for some rain as well,\u201d Roarke warned her. \u201cWe\u2019re likely in for a storm later.\u201d \u201cBefore it\u2019s over, Greg Barney\u2019s going to find out I\u2019m the goddamn storm.\u201d When she went in to shower, Roarke looked at the cat. \u201cShe\u2019s not wrong about that, as we well know. Let\u2019s feed the storm, shall we?\u201d When she came out, he put his tablet aside. He enjoyed seeing her in a robe, which certainly explained why he couldn\u2019t resist buying them for her. This one was as close as he\u2019d dared come to pink, with its deep rose tone, and in silk that shimmered, just a little. He took off the domes as she sat, and found himself pleased when she gave the full Irish a nod and a narrow look. \u201cThat\u2019s just right for today.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll let me know, won\u2019t you, when you have him?\u201d \u201cSure. I want to take him at his shop. Mortify him.\u201d She shrugged as she crunched into bacon. \u201cNot necessary, but it\u2019s a personal wish.\u201d She glanced at him as she dug into her eggs. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a better day today.\u201d \u201cI will. What\u2019s done\u2019s done. I\u2019ll move along to what\u2019s next\u2014as will you. Don\u2019t wear black today.\u201d She paused as she cut into a fat sausage. \u201cOh, come on.\u201d \u201cWear a strong color, but not black. He\u2019ll understand and respect the cut, the fabric. Add a strong color, and you\u2019ll intimidate, just a bit, along with it. A vest, once you\u2019re in the box, so your weapon\u2019s visible.\u201d \u201cI like that part,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt, at least until he notices, to leave this out.\u201d He slid a hand over to lift the chain of the Giant\u2019s Tear diamond she wore under her shirts. \u201cI don\u2019t like to wear it out on the job. Cops don\u2019t wear big, fat diamonds.\u201d \u201cExactly. This, the weapon, the clothes, the woman in charge? For his type, there\u2019ll be some confusion along with the intimidation. He won\u2019t like you and Peabody being in control. He manages people, and he\u2019s superior to women.\u201d She considered as she ate. \u201cOkay, those are solid points. And you\u2019ve made it so fricking complicated I\u2019m going to say you pick it all out. Which was your plan anyway.\u201d \u201cConsider it my contribution to helping him into a cage. I was there at the crime scene, Eve, and saw her in the room where you once were.\u201d He settled on a jacket in a strong sharp blue and a vest in something like dark copper\u2014but thankfully not shiny. The pants matched the jacket, but had a stripe of that something like dark copper down the sides. And somehow she had a pair of boots in the same tone. He added a collared shirt in white. She studied herself in the shirt and vest and weapon, and decided, as usual, he\u2019d been right. \u201cTake the diamond out.\u201d When she did, she nodded. Okay, it made a statement, and a contrast. But she tucked it away again. \u201cMaybe in the box, just for a few seconds.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all you\u2019ll need.\u201d He rose when she swung the jacket on. He pulled her in and kissed her. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t stand a chance against you. But take care of my cop in any case.\u201d He patted her hip where he\u2019d discovered a bruise the night before. \u201cAnd watch out for piss-soaked junkies.\u201d \u201cYou can bank on that one.\u201d She cupped his face, looked in his eyes. \u201cTake care of my gazillionaire.\u201d \u201cI will. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t\u2014or not too much, she thought as she started downstairs. She just found it \u2026 disconcerting when he lost his balance. But he\u2019d found it again, so she wouldn\u2019t worry too much. And she was about to take what she was determined would be the last steps in bringing down a killer. She worked on her strategy\u2014first in dealing with Shauna Hunnicut\u2014on the way downtown. She could leave any needed softening and stroking on that to Peabody. And the push she\u2019d handle herself. In the garage, she took the elevator halfway up before escaping the chaos of change of shift for the glides. Since she\u2019d beaten her squad in, she went straight to her office, then tagged Peabody. ETA to Central? Just got here, waiting for elevator. My office as soon as you get here. Knowing the elevator, Eve waited a couple of minutes before programming coffee. When she heard Peabody\u2019s clump, she sat. Then pointed to the mug of coffee and to the visitor\u2019s chair. \u201cSit. I\u2019ll fill you in and tell you how I think it\u2019s going to go. It\u2019s going to be jewelry,\u201d she began as Peabody snagged the mug. \u201cYou think he took some jewelry from the apartment?\u201d \u201cYeah, and here\u2019s why.\u201d \n Chapter Twenty-two When Shauna opened the door of Angie Decker\u2019s apartment, she looked like someone recovering from a long, enervating illness. She stared at Eve with hope sparking in her deeply shadowed eyes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to report yet, and we\u2019re sorry to intrude. Could we have a minute?\u201d \u201cSure. Of course.\u201d The apartment smelled of flowers\u2014some of which, Eve noted, had been at the memorial. And the apartment felt empty but for the three of them. \u201cIs Ms. Decker here?\u201d \u201cNo. She had to go to work. People have to start living their lives again.\u201d She gestured toward a tablet on the table. \u201cI\u2019m starting an apartment search\u2014trying to because it\u2019s hard to imagine\u2026\u201d Tears swirled. Shauna pressed the heels of her hands against them as if to push them back. She won the struggle, dropped her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard. But I can\u2019t stay with Angie indefinitely. I\u2014I had next week off anyway, so I\u2019m hoping I can find a place, something in the same neighborhood, and start moving in. \u201cIs this about ChiChi?\u201d \u201cNot directly. You should know she\u2019s agreed to plead guilty to the assault in exchange for mandatory community service and anger management training.\u201d \u201cFine. It doesn\u2019t matter. It really doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m sorry, let\u2019s sit down.\u201d \u201cActually, I need to ask you for something.\u201d \u201cAll right. Oh, the painting? Glenda told me you wanted to buy one of Erin\u2019s paintings. The one she did of the pizzeria. She thought it would cheer me up. It did, a little.\u201d Sitting, she looked around blankly, like someone just waking from a hard sleep. \u201cShauna, we need you to come with us, to go through your apartment with us.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Panic leapt into her eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who\u2019ll know, for certain, if anything\u2019s missing.\u201d \u201cBut \u2026 Erin wasn\u2019t killed there. It wasn\u2019t a break-in. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a loose end we need to tie up before we can move to the next stage of the investigation.\u201d \u201cWhat stage? What stage?\u201d She pushed out of the chair. \u201cWe were supposed to be married on Saturday. Do you know what we should be doing today? We should be putting up decorations for the wedding. We should be laughing and arguing about what goes where. And checking with the florist\u2014we didn\u2019t order a lot, but we each wanted bouquets, and flowers on the tables we\u2019d set up. Now I have those.\u201d She pointed at the flowers on the table. \u201cI have those, from her memorial. Now you want me to go back to the apartment where we lived together, made all these plans, where we had a life together?\u201d \u201cYes, I do.\u201d \u201cDo you think I killed her?\u201d It wasn\u2019t anger, but absolute devastation. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll go there and break down and confess I killed the woman I loved?\u201d \u201cNo. You\u2019re not, nor have you ever been, a suspect.\u201d \u201cThen why? How could this possibly help you find who killed her?\u201d \u201cBecause if something\u2019s not there that should be, you\u2019ll know.\u201d She dropped into a chair again, covered her pale face with her hands. \u201cGod, God. I know I\u2019m being stupid about this. I know it\u2019s weak, but\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not stupid,\u201d Peabody corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s not weak. It\u2019s grief, and it\u2019s human and it\u2019s hard. We wouldn\u2019t ask if we didn\u2019t think it\u2019s important.\u201d Dropping her hands, Shauna stared at Peabody. \u201cBecca and Greg have gone in to get some of my things, to clean out the food stuff. And Donna and Angie helped Erin\u2019s family get some of her things.\u201d \u201cBut you know what they removed,\u201d Eve said. \u201cYes.\u201d Shauna closed her eyes, took a breath. When she opened them again, she looked at Eve. \u201cYou really think doing this will matter? Will help you find who killed her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI need to get my purse.\u201d When she walked away, Eve shook her head. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t believe me, doesn\u2019t believe this matters.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s doing it. It\u2019s hard for her, but she\u2019ll do it.\u201d \u201cYeah. She\u2019s tougher than she looks, but it\u2019s going to hurt. Let\u2019s make it as quick as possible.\u201d Shauna said nothing as they drove the short distance from apartment building to apartment building. She broke her silence when Eve pulled into a loading zone. \u201cI bet delivery people hate when you do that.\u201d Eve flipped on her On Duty light. \u201cYou win that bet.\u201d Under the circumstances, Eve tolerated the elevator ride to four. Outside the apartment door, Eve waited while Shauna hesitated. Peabody laid a hand on Shauna\u2019s arm. \u201cMaybe ask yourself what Erin would do.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019d go in, get it done.\u201d Shauna unlocked the door, opened it. \u201cIt looks so much like us,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWho we were together. She used to say I had all the style, she had all the color, and how frosty it was we were each picking some of the other\u2019s up.\u201d Slowly, she walked around the living area. \u201cI was going to sell the furniture. I\u2019d keep her paintings, and maybe a few little things, but sell the rest. That was wrong. We bought most of this together, or brought it with us from our own spaces. I was going to sell it.\u201d She brushed a hand over the back of the sofa. \u201cBut no, no, that\u2019s wrong. We\u2019d sit here, watch a vid. We\u2019d have takeaway and sit over there and talk and talk. I thought it would feel empty, but it doesn\u2019t. I know I can\u2019t live here anymore, but I can take some of what we shared with me.\u201d She turned to Eve and Peabody. \u201cI should\u2019ve come back before.\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t ready before,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be.\u201d She wandered a bit more. \u201cEverything\u2019s here that should be. Honestly, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for, or why.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s try the bedroom.\u201d Her eyes on Shauna, Eve gestured. \u201cBecca got clothes for me,\u201d she said as she walked to the bedroom door. \u201cToiletries and all that. She picked up what I\u2019d need for making the arrangements, the memorial.\u201d \u201cOutfits, clothes, jewelry?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start with the jewelry?\u201d \u201cFine, but it\u2019s not like I\u2014either of us\u2014have anything really valuable. It\u2019s mostly costume. We were going to exchange rings, so we\u2014I\u2014have those, but they weren\u2019t really expensive.\u201d She opened a drawer. \u201cHere they are,\u201d she murmured. \u201cRight here.\u201d She opened the ring boxes, brushed a finger over each. Then she slipped one on the ring finger of her left hand. \u201cI have skinnier fingers.\u201d And put the other on the middle finger of her right. \u201cIt fits well enough there. Is it just whack that it makes me feel better wearing these?\u201d Eve said simply, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to wear them both. At least for a while, I\u2019m going to wear them both. Okay.\u201d She breathed out. \u201cI have these sapphire studs my parents gave me for my twenty-first. It\u2019s my birthstone. Most valuable I have, and they\u2019re right here.\u201d She went through carefully, piece by piece. \u201cEverything\u2019s here, except what Becca brought to me. Erin has more. She has more\u2014not expensive\u2014just more, and I know her parents took some pieces.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s all your jewelry?\u201d \u201cYes. Oh, well, no, now that you mention it. I have some sentimental pieces. I don\u2019t wear them, but\u2026\u201d She crouched down, opened the bottom drawer. Then sitting back on her heels, frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s funny. Did I move the box?\u201d Eve cast her mind back to the search the morning after the murder. \u201cA small red box, hinged lid. A few pieces of jewelry inside.\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. High school stuff. Nothing I\u2019ve worn since, really, but\u2014\u201d \u201cSentimental,\u201d Peabody finished after exchanging a look over Shauna\u2019s head with Eve. \u201cYeah.\u201d She pushed through the other items in the drawer. Gym clothes, Eve remembered, old sweats, and things you\u2019d wear if you expected to get sweaty or dirty. \u201cI must\u2019ve moved it. It\u2019s just a few things Greg gave me back in our day. A sweet little ring, some earrings, a necklace. Birthdays, Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, that kind of thing.\u201d She rose. \u201cI must\u2019ve put them somewhere else. Maybe the closet.\u201d \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. I saw them in that drawer the day after the murder.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Shauna went to the closet anyway. Rose on her toes to look at the top shelf. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Becca would\u2019ve moved\u2026\u201d Trailing off, she turned. Color poured into her face. \u201cYou think Becca\u2014that\u2019s ridiculous, and it\u2019s awful. She would never, never hurt Erin. Plus, for fuck\u2019s sake, she was onstage with me when \u2026 when it happened.\u201d \u201cTell me who knew where you kept those pieces?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2026\u201d She ran a hand over her hair. \u201cI guess everybody could have. I bought the little box years ago, because sentimental. I probably said how I liked looking at them once in a while and remembering those days. I know I said Erin didn\u2019t mind and I remember how Jon had. A lot. It was one of the reasons I knew we didn\u2019t fit.\u201d As she spoke, she opened more drawers, pawed through. \u201cThey\u2019re not worth anything, not really, to anyone but me.\u201d \u201cPeabody. Reo.\u201d \u201cOn that.\u201d Peabody stepped out. Her face set now, and with some color back in her cheeks, Shauna turned to Eve. \u201cYou knew something would be missing, and there is. But I don\u2019t understand why.\u201d \u201cShauna, I\u2019m going to ask you some questions, but before I do, I need to trust you. Whatever we say here stays here. You can\u2019t and won\u2019t contact anyone, speak to anyone about what we say here.\u201d Those blue eyes went hot, went sharp. \u201cYou know who killed her. You know.\u201d She gestured toward the bed in a gesture as hot and sharp as her eyes. \u201cWe slept there together. We didn\u2019t just have sex, we slept there, woke there, laughed there, made plans there. On Saturday, we\u2019d have put on the white dresses we bought together, hung in that closet, and we\u2019d have made promises to each other. \u201cYou can trust me, Lieutenant, to not do anything, anything that will stop you from locking up whoever took her from me.\u201d \u201cI believe you. How did Greg react when you started dating Erin?\u201d Some of the fresh color faded from her cheeks. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly\u2014\u201d \u201cHe gave you those pieces,\u201d Eve pointed out. \u201cHe knew you kept them, correct?\u201d \u201cYes. Yes. I\u2014I told him, God, I can\u2019t remember when, that I kept Shaunbar in a pretty red box in my bottom drawer. He\u2014he thought it was sweet.\u201d \u201cAnd when you and Erin started dating, what did he think?\u201d She reached behind her until she felt the foot of the bed, then slowly sat. \u201cHe was surprised, and maybe a little \u2026 I don\u2019t know, disappointed? You have to understand, his family is very set. Man, woman, husband, wife.\u201d She chopped a hand in the air at each word. \u201cThey\u2019re not mean about it, just set. So he was surprised and maybe disappointed. But\u2014\u201d \u201cAngry.\u201d Shauna rubbed a hand between her breasts. \u201cI guess, a little. It was more like \u2018What the hell,\u2019 you know? He thought\u2014at first, he thought\u2014she was a kind of bad influence. I can\u2019t remember exactly what he said, but we had a little fight about it.\u201d \u201cYou had a fight?\u201d \u201cMore a disagreement, and it was over a year ago. I told him what I did with my life, who I slept with, and so on wasn\u2019t any of his business. I was pretty harsh because I was already in love with her and he was so critical. But we made up, he apologized. And he and Erin got along fine. More than. You can\u2019t expect me to believe my oldest friend would have\u2026\u201d \u201cWho else could have taken the box, Shauna? Who else did that jewelry mean anything to?\u201d \u201cI must\u2019ve misplaced it. No, no, you said you saw it after \u2026 but\u2014\u201d \u201cWould Erin have trusted him? She wanted to surprise you with something you dreamed of, and Donna was out of town. Would she have trusted him?\u201d Her eyes went dead. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHe knew about Maui. When you were together in high school, the two of you talked about it.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Her voice sounded dead as well. \u201cAfter college. We\u2019d get married after college when we both had jobs. And we\u2019d honeymoon in Maui because I\u2019d wanted that since I was a little girl.\u201d She didn\u2019t weep. Her eyes stayed dull and dead, and she didn\u2019t weep. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she trust him? He was my oldest friend. I\u2019ve known him since middle school.\u201d \u201cDallas.\u201d Peabody spoke from the doorway, then nodded. \u201cShauna, we\u2019re going to take you back to Angie\u2019s. I need you to stay there, and I need you to keep your word.\u201d \u201cDo you think I\u2019d speak to him about this?\u201d She got to her feet. \u201cHe knew where I kept the jewelry, and taking it was petty. He can be petty, but that\u2019s something you overlook in a friend. She would have trusted him. I trusted him. He always thinks he knows what I should do, what\u2019s best for me. I overlooked that, too, or ignored it. And if I got pissed about it, he\u2019d back off, apologize. \u2018Just trying to look out for you, Shaunbar.\u2019 He\u2019d call me that to make me laugh.\u201d She laid a hand on her heart. \u201cIn here, I\u2019m not ready to believe he could do anything like this. But in here?\u201d She touched her other hand to the side of her head. \u201cI can. Oh God, God, I can.\u201d She dropped both hands. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my word, but I need yours. You have to tell me, if you prove it\u2019s true, you have to tell me right away.\u201d \u201cYou have my word.\u201d When they dropped her off, Eve watched her walk inside. \u201cShe won\u2019t contact anyone, least of all him. But let\u2019s make this as fast as possible, too.\u201d \u201cWe got the search warrant for his apartment. When we find the box\u2014and we have to hope like hell he didn\u2019t toss it all\u2014\u201d \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. Shaunbar\u2019s too important to him.\u201d \u201cOkay. When we find it, we\u2019ll get the arrest for robbery.\u201d \u201cEnough to take him in, sweat out the rest. He\u2019ll have excuses for taking the box,\u201d Eve continued as she drove. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be sure, at first, he can talk his way out of this. He sells, he manages, and we\u2019re just women, after all.\u201d \u201cThen this should be fun.\u201d \u201cNot for him,\u201d Eve said, and considered it a stroke of Roarke luck when she zipped into a place right outside the apartment building. A third-floor unit, almost within shouting distance of where Shauna and Erin lived. No cams, crap security. She mastered in, hit the stairs. The soundproofing was better than Shauna\u2019s building, but not by much. This time instead of wailing, a baby laughed somewhere on the second floor. Though she decided it was hard to tell the difference. On three, she knocked first. \u201cNYPSD, Lieutenant Dallas, Detective Peabody, record on. Please open the door.\u201d When she got no response, she knocked a second time. \u201cDallas and Peabody entering premises by master for a duly warranted search and seizure.\u201d She mastered in, looked around while Peabody secured the door behind them. Not too dissimilar from the apartment they\u2019d just been in. More stylish, Eve supposed, not as bold and bright, but a similar footprint. One of Erin\u2019s paintings hung in the living area\u2014a street scene showcasing Barney\u2019s men\u2019s shop. A gift, no doubt, and now insured for its increased value. \u201cNo clutter,\u201d she observed. \u201cNo lived-in mess, and well-coordinated. Like a man\u2019s suit.\u201d \u201cYou could say that,\u201d Peabody agreed. \u201cNothing out of place.\u201d \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t keep it in a communal area. Bedroom, his space in there.\u201d They took the short hallway, turned. \u201cNice and neat, but you can see they\u2019ve been busy and distracted for a few days\u2014things a little jumbled on this dresser\u2014hers\u2014perfume bottle, little dish with stuff tossed in. This one\u2019s his, and that highboy, too, I\u2019d wager. He\u2019ll have more than her. Got himself matching shoehorn, clothes brush.\u201d Eve started to the highboy. \u201cOne closet, so communal. It won\u2019t be there.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got his dresser.\u201d Eve took the highboy. She opened the top drawer first. She had about four inches on Becca, and the drawer hit her about chin level. Socks, folded, not rolled, and color coordinated in dividers. She pulled it all the way out. \u201cJesus, this was too easy.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d \u201cNope. He slid it in the back of the drawer, behind some red socks.\u201d Eve took it out, opened it. \u201cAnd here\u2019s Shaunbar. Ring, couple pair of earrings, necklace, two bracelets.\u201d She bagged it, sealed, labeled. \u201cWould he keep the garrote? Hard to believe that, but since we\u2019re here.\u201d A few minutes later, Peabody called out, \u201cNot the garrote, but I\u2019ve got piano wire.\u201d Peabody held up the package. \u201cAnd funny, they don\u2019t have a piano.\u201d \u201cBag it,\u201d Eve said, \u201cand let\u2019s go bag him.\u201d With, Eve thought when she double-parked in front of the men\u2019s shop, as much humiliation as possible. Several horns blasted as she stepped onto the sidewalk. She ignored them. The display window showed a couple of fake men. One wore a sharp charcoal suit with needle pinstripes that made her wonder if Baxter shopped there. The other, though it was sweltering August, wore a forest-green sweater with black leather pants. It had a scarf in dull gold tossed jauntily around its neck. She stepped in to cool air scented with something between pine and cedar. Summer stuff\u2014though sweltering August\u2014was displayed on a sales rack or neatly folded on shelves. Suits, hung in sections by designers, comprised most of one wall. Dress shirts, crisp and folded, were stacked in cubbies. Casual wear took the opposite side, and accessories\u2014ties, cuff links, wallets, belts, and so on\u2014had glass displays in the center. It boosted her to see one of the staff with a customer while the other approached her with a smile. \u201cGood morning, ladies\u2014nearly afternoon now! How can I be of service?\u201d \u201cYou can get the manager.\u201d His young, slick, handsome face showed concern. \u201cOh, is there a problem?\u201d \u201cApparently. Where\u2019s Greg Barney?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s in the dressing room area with a client. If I could assist\u2014\u201d \u201cYou can, by getting him.\u201d \u201cOf course. Just one moment.\u201d As he hurried off, the shop door opened. Eve recognized Allisandra Charro, personal shopper, from a case they\u2019d recently closed. And Charro recognized her. Beaming smiles, she stepped forward in red stilettos and offered a perfectly manicured hand. \u201cWhy, Lieutenant Dallas! We meet at last. I helped you identify a murderous teenager by his Stubens.\u201d \u201cI remember.\u201d \u201cShopping for Roarke?\u201d \u201cNo. On duty.\u201d \u201cReally? How exciting. I\u2019m just here to make some selections for a client\u2014whom I assume has no murderous intent.\u201d \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d As Barney came out, Eve walked toward him. \u201cOh, Lieutenant, Detective. If I\u2019d known\u2014 You\u2019ve charged that terrible woman.\u201d \u201cYeah, we did. And now it\u2019s your turn. Greg Barney, you\u2019re under arrest for robbery.\u201d \u201cWhat? What? That\u2019s insane. I\u2019ve never stolen anything in my life!\u201d She sort of hoped he\u2019d resist, but apparently he was too shocked to make a fuss as she cuffed him. \u201cYou have the right to remain silent,\u201d she began as Peabody flanked him and they started out. \u201cThis is some crazy mistake. Roderick, take over. I\u2019ll have this sorted out in no time.\u201d \u201cBet you don\u2019t. You have the right to an attorney and/or legal representation,\u201d Eve continued as they walked him out. \u201cI\u2019d absolutely love to dress you,\u201d Charro called out. \u201cMore than ever!\u201d \u201cI take care of that all by myself.\u201d She continued the Revised Miranda, and Barney, flushed to the roots of his hair with mortification, continued to protest his innocence. \u201cThis is outrageous!\u201d he began to sputter when secured in the back of the car. \u201cYou\u2019ve embarrassed me at my place of business.\u201d Hope so, Eve thought as she got behind the wheel. \u201cI\u2019m not a thief. What am I supposed to have stolen? How could you do something like this?\u201d \u201cWith a warrant.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I haven\u2019t stolen anything, so you can\u2019t have a warrant.\u201d \u201cRight here.\u201d Helpfully, Peabody held up the warrant she\u2019d printed out on her PPC. \u201cI assumed the two of you were reasonably competent, but now I see why it took you days to arrest that stripper for Erin\u2019s murder.\u201d Peabody started to speak, caught Eve\u2019s slight head shake, and let that ride. \u201cI told you it was some lowlife, and it was. Shauna should never have associated with someone like that, and wouldn\u2019t have except for Erin.\u201d Keep talking, Eve thought. Record\u2019s on, rights read. \u201cNow you come into my shop, in front of clients and staff, and drag me out like a common criminal.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t recall any dragging. Do you recall dragging, Peabody?\u201d \u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t. And the record will show no dragging involved. He actually came along fairly meekly.\u201d She shifted to smile at him. \u201cThanks for your cooperation.\u201d \u201cIt shows what happens when the flighty are given authority.\u201d \u201cNow we\u2019re flighty,\u201d Eve observed. \u201cPeabody, we\u2019re incompetent, flighty draggers.\u201d \u201cMaybe. But he\u2019s the one in cuffs.\u201d Pride swelled in Eve\u2019s chest as she pulled into the garage. \u201cAnd here we are, home again.\u201d When they got him out of the back, he jutted out his chin. \u201cI can tolerate mistakes. People make mistakes. But there\u2019s no excuse for humiliating me at my workplace. There will be recompense.\u201d \u201cCounting on that,\u201d Eve said, and led him into the elevator. \u201cDetective Peabody is going to process you, then we\u2019ll have a nice chat, the three of us, in Interview.\u201d \u201cThe sooner this is sorted out, the better.\u201d His chin continued to jut as the elevator stopped to let in more cops. \u201cAnd once we do, you will come to the shop, apologize to me in front of my staff, and you will contact Mr. Henrich and Ms. Charro and explain your mistake.\u201d One of the cops in the car slid an amused glance in Eve\u2019s direction. \u201cDoesn\u2019t know you very well, does he?\u201d Eve just smiled. \u201cNot yet. He\u2019s about to.\u201d \n Chapter Twenty-three Smarter, Eve decided as she prepped for the interview, to have yelled lawyer right off the jump. But he considered himself in the clear on the murder, and as far as he was concerned hadn\u2019t stolen anything. Add he considered himself smarter than a couple of female cops, and he\u2019d decided to forgo that one. For now. Tagging a lawyer also meant someone else knew about his arrest. He wouldn\u2019t want that. She put the evidence bags in an evidence box, added some crime scene photos to a file. Then, checking the time, tagged Roarke. His face filled the screen. \u201cLieutenant, you just caught me. Lunch meeting coming up.\u201d \u201cWell, bon app\u00e9tit there. Just letting you know I\u2019m bringing Barney into the box.\u201d \u201cFor the murder.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019ll be the end result. We\u2019re starting off with theft. What he took out of Shauna\u2019s apartment that day. I knew it. Now I know what. Some baubles he\u2019d given her back in high school. She\u2019d kept them in a box for sentiment. I guess he couldn\u2019t have that, so when he had the chance\u2014alone in her place\u2014he took the box. He hid it in his sock drawer.\u201d \u201cHis sock drawer? Not very clever.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s the top of one of those highboy things. He has his socks folded, in dividers, color coordinated. It\u2019s a red box, so with the red socks. Do you do that with yours? The folding, coordinating thing? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been in your sock drawer.\u201d \u201cWhy would you? But you\u2019re welcome to, as if I had anything to hide, I would be a great deal more clever. If I could postpone this meeting, I\u2019d come down and watch you break him. Always an education.\u201d Gone, she noted, was the sad, broody, angry Roarke of the night before. He looked like busy, in-charge Roarke now. \u201cWe will break him, and I appreciate the assist in getting him this far.\u201d \u201cAnytime, Lieutenant. I\u2019ll expect to be fully briefed when I see you at home.\u201d \u201cCheck it. Later.\u201d She clicked off, then gathered her things for Interview A. She sat as if studiously studying the file when Peabody led him in. The Giant\u2019s Tear hung, flashing, outside her shirt. \u201cRecord on. Have a seat, Greg. Dallas, Lieutenant Eve, and Peabody, Detective Delia, in Interview with Barney, Greg, in the matter of file number R/T-98721. Also of interest in this interview, file number H-7823. \u201cMr. Barney, have you been read your rights?\u201d \u201cYou know very well I have.\u201d He fussed with his tie. \u201cYou recited them to me yourself after deliberately humiliating me at work.\u201d \u201cWell then, let\u2019s get started.\u201d \u201cI demand to know, right now, what I\u2019m accused of. Just what are you deluded into believing I stole?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you?\u201d After opening the evidence box, she removed the evidence bag with the red trinket box. He went very still, and his face went from annoyed to a cold, hard mask. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cWhere you put it. Your sock drawer\u2014lots of fancy socks, Greg. Red box, red socks. Found it in about ten seconds.\u201d \u201cAnd what gives you the right to go into my home, to paw through my personal belongings?\u201d \u201cPeabody?\u201d \u201cWhy, that would be this warrant.\u201d \u201cDuly executed,\u201d Eve added. \u201cThis and what it contains are not your property, Greg. Hence, theft.\u201d \u201cI knew this was a ridiculous mistake.\u201d He huffed out a breath, leaned in a bit. \u201cI gave what\u2019s in that box to Shauna.\u201d \u201cGifts.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, gifts.\u201d \u201cAre you aware that once you give a gift, it no longer belongs to you? Hence, I repeat, theft.\u201d \u201cI took them for safekeeping. Shauna\u2019s not been herself, as you should understand. She\u2019s had a trauma, and isn\u2019t thinking straight right now. She\u2019s talking about selling most of her things, and since I know she values those gifts, has kept them for years, I didn\u2019t want them to get somehow lost in the shuffle.\u201d \u201cSo you took them, without asking her. Hence, I\u2019m forced to repeat, theft.\u201d \u201cShe would never think of it that way. People are going through her apartment. Friends and relatives of Erin. Who knows what they might take? I just wanted to keep them safe until she\u2019s feeling better.\u201d \u201cSo, worried about thievery, you committed same.\u201d \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d He waved that away. \u201cContact Shauna. She\u2019ll say it\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cYet, you hid this.\u201d She tapped the box. \u201cI didn\u2019t hide it. I placed it.\u201d \u201cIn the back of your sock drawer. Without mentioning it to your cohab\u2014that\u2019s Becca, isn\u2019t it? Also a good, concerned friend of Shauna\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI may have mentioned it. I don\u2019t recall.\u201d \u201cPeabody, why don\u2019t you step out and contact Becca DiNuzio, since Greg\u2019s memory is sketchy on it?\u201d \u201cI probably didn\u2019t.\u201d He waved that away again. \u201cWe\u2019ve been busy, distracted. A friend was murdered. Our closest friend is grieving.\u201d \u201cYou took this, with its contents, from Shauna\u2019s apartment the evening you were there, ostensibly to remove items from the AC and the friggie.\u201d \u201cNothing ostensibly about it. That\u2019s what I did. I thought of the box while I was clearing out. Maybe I acted impulsively.\u201d He shrugged at that. \u201cBut with what was best for Shauna in my heart and mind.\u201d \u201cYou decide what\u2019s best for her?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s grieving,\u201d he said with insulting patience. \u201cShe\u2019s hardly in the state of mind to make logical choices. This is a waste of time. A five-second \u2019link call to Shauna will straighten this out. And then, I damn well expect those apologies.\u201d \u201cRight. You didn\u2019t much like Erin Albright, did you, Greg?\u201d He managed to look shocked and insulted at once. \u201cOf course I did! She was Shauna\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. And I\u2019m very grateful you, finally, caught her killer. But that doesn\u2019t excuse\u2014\u201d \u201cYeah, we caught her killer.\u201d Eve tapped the box again, then, taking it out of the evidence bag, opened it. \u201cWhat do you think, Peabody?\u201d \u201cSweet, pretty. Immature, but suitable for a high school girl.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re classic.\u201d He spoke coldly. \u201cTimeless. Simple, yes, but classic, so used to dress up or dress down.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re the fashion guy. Still, she kept them separate from her other jewelry. She didn\u2019t wear these anymore.\u201d \u201cShe could have. Her choice.\u201d \u201cYeah, hers. Like Erin was her choice. You were her choice once. Shaunbar.\u201d \u201cIn high school. Happy memories, yes, and a strong bond between us. But I\u2019m in a committed relationship with someone else.\u201d \u201cFrom high school.\u201d His jaw tensed, then jutted again. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely different now, for all of us.\u201d \u201cIt really is. Shauna was also in a committed relationship.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d \u201cAnd now you\u2019ll help her rebuild her life, move past the trauma.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll certainly try.\u201d \u201cBecause you look out for her. Making her sandwiches, walking her home from work when you can manage it, giving advice, doing favors.\u201d His long sigh added a fresh layer to that insulting patience. \u201cFriends tend to do all of that. Good friends, real friends certainly do. Now, I\u2019d like to leave. If you\u2019d just contact Shauna\u2014\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to her already,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cAnd she couldn\u2019t think of why you, or anyone, would take that box and the jewelry inside.\u201d That concerned him, Eve noted, as his eyes darted away. \u201cBecause you haven\u2019t let me talk to her, explain to her. As I think I\u2019ve clearly explained to you.\u201d \u201cSo you took it upon yourself to go into her bedroom\u2014without her knowledge or permission\u2014go through her dresser\u2014without her knowledge or permission\u2014remove a box containing jewelry\u2014without her knowledge or permission. Then hid same in your own bedroom, in your own dresser. That\u2019s your explanation for stealing?\u201d She could actually see the muscles in his face tighten. \u201cYou\u2019re being deliberately obtuse.\u201d His tone, deeply patronizing, carried an edge of ripe temper. \u201cObtuse and flighty? I wonder what\u2019s next.\u201d \u201cI simply didn\u2019t want Shauna to do something she\u2019d regret. And given her emotional state\u2014\u201d \u201cAre you her therapist, too?\u201d Peabody widened her eyes. \u201cA man of many facets.\u201d \u201cOh, blow me.\u201d When that edge went jagged, the smile Eve held inside was broad and fierce. \u201cSorry,\u201d Peabody countered. \u201cPerforming sexual acts in Interview is frowned upon.\u201d \u201cThis is bullshit. I was acting in the best interest of a friend who tends to act on impulse and emotion in the best of times. Which these clearly aren\u2019t. Now, I\u2019m done with this. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d \u201cSit your ass down.\u201d The whiplash in Eve\u2019s voice had him jerking. \u201cWe\u2019re in charge here,\u201d she reminded him. He sat, but eyed her with derision. \u201cYou won\u2019t be when this is over. Trust me on that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a police lieutenant with a dozen years behind my badge. Do you think I\u2019m afraid of some guy who sells overpriced ties? Some guy who steals some cheap jewelry from a friend and hides it in his sock drawer?\u201d \u201cI manage a well-respected men\u2019s store that caters to a discerning clientele. And the jewelry I gave Shauna wasn\u2019t cheap. It may not compare to that rock around your neck, but it wasn\u2019t cheap. It was appropriate.\u201d \u201cThis?\u201d Deliberately, she lifted the diamond by its chain. \u201cI just wear this for sentiment.\u201d Which was absolute truth, she thought as she dropped it under her shirt. \u201cSo you stole and secreted this\u2014appropriate\u2014jewelry because you were looking out for your impulsive, emotional friend\u2019s best interest?\u201d \u201cI removed them to safekeeping for Shauna\u2019s best interest, yes.\u201d \u201cYou like to decide what\u2019s in others\u2019 best interest. Such as\u2026\u201d She opened the file. \u201cLeRoy Vic, a former assistant manager at your place of employment. You decided it wasn\u2019t in his best interest to move to Brooklyn with his pregnant wife and take the manager\u2019s position at another store\u2014and took steps to prevent that.\u201d \u201cWhat is this!\u201d Outrage sizzled, and burned two spots of color in his cheeks. \u201cYou dug up a former employee\u2014a classically disgruntled employee\u2014to try to undermine me? He wasn\u2019t ready for the position and lacked the necessary leadership qualities to\u2014\u201d \u201cBut served as your assistant manager?\u201d \u201cAssistant is key,\u201d Barney snapped back. \u201cI was doing my best to groom him, mentor him. A few more years under my supervision, and\u2014\u201d \u201cHis sales were excellent, and his previous evaluations prior to this desired move? Also excellent.\u201d \u201cHe wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d Barney did the chin-jut thing again, and this time folded his arms. \u201cAnd what does my decision as a manager have to do with any of this?\u201d \u201cIn your capacity as manager, you also decided what was best for Sharlene Wilson.\u201d \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d \u201cOn several occasions you suggested Ms. Wilson should resign her part-time position and take professional parent status instead.\u201d \u201cShe had children at home.\u201d \u201cI see. So in your opinion, women who choose to have a child or children shouldn\u2019t also choose to work outside the home?\u201d \u201cIf I recall correctly, Sharlene\u2019s professional mother stipend would have been more than her monthly pay from On Trend, where she worked, essentially, a handful of hours a week.\u201d \u201cEspecially after you hired another part-time\u2014male\u2014employee and cut her hours.\u201d \u201cThat was a managerial decision, and I don\u2019t have to explain it to you.\u201d \u201cNo, you don\u2019t, mostly because it explains itself. You like to manage people. You get to decide what they should do, how they should do it. How they should live. What\u2019s best for them. Then you take the necessary steps to see they stay inside the lines you\u2019ve drawn.\u201d Eve studied him, tapped her fingers on the table. \u201cIt makes me wonder, Greg. What do you do when they refuse to stay inside those lines? How far would you go? Obviously, stealing isn\u2019t off the table.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve explained that. I\u2019m not going to keep repeating myself. Shauna will understand, and will back me a hundred percent, so your intimidation tactics are a waste of time. If you had any common sense or any respect for the position you somehow found yourself holding, you\u2019d let me speak with her and clear this up.\u201d \u201cI bet it pissed you off she put what you gave her in a box.\u201d Peabody drew his attention back to her. \u201cAnd stuck the box in a drawer with her gym and slop clothes. Never wore what you gave her.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know the first thing about it.\u201d \u201cTell us about it, Greg,\u201d Peabody urged. \u201cTell us how it felt to have Shauna put Shaunbar away, and live her life the way she chose. How even after college, she wasn\u2019t interested in taking Shaunbar out for another spin.\u201d \u201cThat was a mutual decision. We\u2019d both moved on.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of moving,\u201d Eve picked up, \u201cafter college, after a brief adjustment period back in the old neighborhood, she moved to Manhattan. And you followed right along soon after, like a puppy. Even moved into the same building.\u201d \u201cFor employment, and convenience to my employment.\u201d \u201cSo the fact you took employment near hers, moved into the same apartment building had nothing to do with good old Shaunbar.\u201d \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I move into the same building as a good friend?\u201d he demanded, but looked away. \u201cWhen it\u2019s convenient to my work.\u201d \u201cThen, lo and behold, you start dating another old schoolmate. And one Shauna\u2019s connected with, made good friends with. In fact, what they both consider best friends.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s strange about that? Becca and I began seeing each other, initially through Shauna. We fell in love.\u201d \u201cDid you? Or was she just second choice because Shauna didn\u2019t want you?\u201d \u201cHow dare you!\u201d He slapped a fist on the table. \u201cHow dare you speak about the woman I\u2019m going to marry that way.\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019re engaged.\u201d Peabody clapped her hands together. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d \u201cNot yet. We will be.\u201d \u201cWhen you decide?\u201d Eve asked. \u201cWhen you decide it\u2019s the best time, it\u2019s best for her?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how it works!\u201d As he had during the arrest, he sputtered. \u201cWhen I feel it\u2019s right, I buy the ring, I pick the time, the place, and I propose.\u201d \u201cAnd naturally, she accepts. You decide when and where you\u2019ll get married, then if and when to procreate. And if you do procreate, she\u2019ll set aside her career until such time as you decide the offspring is old enough for her to pick it up again. If ever.\u201d \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but when I take a wife, I will be head of the household. When we have children, I will provide for them, and she will mother them. This is how strong families are built.\u201d Take a wife, Eve thought. That was a good one. \u201cSo parents who both opt to maintain a career aren\u2019t building strong families?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my personal opinion, to which I\u2019m entitled.\u201d \u201cSure you are. But what if both parents are men, or both are women? Who\u2019s the mom who stays home then?\u201d \u201cThe fact there\u2019s that question only demonstrates why such arrangements only foster confusion and difficult family dynamics. I want to speak to Shauna. Now!\u201d \u201cBut this conversation\u2019s so interesting. Aren\u2019t you interested, Peabody?\u201d \u201cFascinated. You know, my aunts Gracie and Lottie have been married for \u2026 golly, I think it\u2019s forty-odd years. Three kids\u2014grown now\u2014I think it\u2019s six grandkids and counting. Gracie\u2019s a large animal vet\u2014you know, horses, cows, like that. Lottie\u2019s a teacher\u2014history, high school level. They\u2019re a pretty strong family.\u201d \u201cIn your opinion,\u201d Barney commented. \u201cYeah.\u201d Peabody just smiled. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got opinions. Of course, I come from a Free-Ager background.\u201d Peabody caught the smirk and only smiled more brightly. \u201cAnd we\u2019re big on tolerance and inclusion.\u201d \u201cAnd from my scan of your background, yours isn\u2019t in the Free-Ager area.\u201d \u201cDecidedly not. No offense,\u201d he said to Peabody. \u201cOh, absolutely none taken.\u201d \u201cGiven your background and stated opinions,\u201d Eve began, \u201cwhat did you think when Shauna became involved with Erin?\u201d \u201cThat she was, again, acting on impulse and the emotion of the moment. She\u2019d dated men who\u2019d disappointed her, or didn\u2019t suit her, so she experimented. Unwisely.\u201d \u201cHow unwisely?\u201d He let out an impatient breath. \u201cAren\u2019t we sitting here right now due to that? Aren\u2019t I being interrogated and humiliated because of that? You\u2019ve arrested the woman responsible for this upheaval in our lives. A person Shauna would never, ever have associated with prior to her involvement with a woman like Erin Albright.\u201d \u201cA woman like Erin?\u201d \u201cA lesbian, for God\u2019s sake. A street artist, basically living hand to mouth, who counted strippers, trans people, gay people, people who constantly engaged in indiscriminate sex among her so-called friends. Freaks and losers.\u201d \u201cClearly you didn\u2019t approve of the relationship.\u201d Fury lived in his eyes as he leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ve known Shauna since we were ten. She comes from a strong, traditional family. She may have pushed some limits in college, that\u2019s almost expected. But she maintained her basic values.\u201d \u201cWhich, you feel, mirror yours. Until Erin.\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cWhat happened to Erin is tragic. It\u2019s horrible, and only more so since she was killed by someone she believed was a friend.\u201d \u201cI completely agree.\u201d Bolstered, he nodded. \u201cHow it affects Shauna is heartbreaking. As someone who basically grew up with her, who cares deeply about her, it breaks mine. In time, she\u2019ll move past it, and find herself again.\u201d \u201cPick up those old values,\u201d Eve said, \u201cand put away the lifestyle that was more\u2026\u201d \u201cBohemian?\u201d Peabody suggested. \u201cBohemian. Good one. Is that accurate, Greg?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cSo as tragic, horrible, heartbreaking as it is, Erin\u2019s death cleared the way for Shauna to get back to where she belongs.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t forgive ChiChi Lopez for what she did, but it does. Yes.\u201d \u201cWell.\u201d Eve looked at Peabody, nodded, looked at Barney, nodded again. \u201cNo wonder you had to kill her.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d He surged up. \u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d \u201cSit down!\u201d \u201cI will not listen to this.\u201d \u201cSit down.\u201d Eve rose slowly. \u201cOr I\u2019ll put you down. And believe me, I\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d \u201cYou have no right to treat me this way.\u201d But he sat. \u201cNo cause to say such things to me. You\u2019ve got Erin\u2019s killer. You arrested her.\u201d \u201cWe arrested Lopez for assault, on Shauna. Not for Erin\u2019s murder\u2014that was your assumption. And boy, did that fit right in for you. The stripper with the garrote in the sex club.\u201d \u201cHey, like Clue! Love that game. But,\u201d Peabody pointed out, \u201cit turns out to be the overbearing ex-boyfriend with the garrote in the sex club.\u201d \u201cSure does. And when you add ex\u2013high school boyfriend, it\u2019s only more pathetic.\u201d \u201cI take mementos for safekeeping, and suddenly I\u2019m a killer?\u201d \u201cThat sure helped. You looked so damn guilty and twitchy when you walked into that hallway and saw me. I knew you\u2019d taken something you shouldn\u2019t have. You should\u2019ve left that alone and I might not have started focusing on you the way I did. That was weak, that was stupid, like it was stupid to try to push the lowlife stranger killer in the sex club on me. I\u2019m a fucking professional.\u201d \u201cThat only proves I care about my friend, not that I killed anyone. If you try to tell Shauna I did, I\u2019ll sue your lying ass off.\u201d \u201cOh, she already knows. She knew when she couldn\u2019t find the red box with the cheap, high school jewelry. She\u2019s been over you for years, Greg. Now, she\u2019s done with you. No more Shaunbar.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019d never believe you. Never.\u201d \u201cWhy? Because you\u2019re so good at playing the great guy, good friend? One who hovers, manipulates, and thinks he knows best? Who believes that, so deeply, he\u2019ll kill for it? For her? You killed Erin for her. You had to protect Shauna, whatever it took. Had to save her from making a terrible mistake. Save her before she married another woman, a bohemian\u2014good word\u2014who would and had led her astray.\u201d \u201cHow could she love Erin,\u201d Peabody added, \u201cwhen she\u2019d been half of Shaunbar? How could she disrespect you, and what you are, by loving a woman?\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t love Erin, but that\u2019s beside the point.\u201d \u201cShe was about to marry Erin,\u201d Eve pointed out. \u201cShe was caught up, but beside the point.\u201d \u201cWhat is the point?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone, you idiot! In fact, I more than tolerated Erin. For fuck\u2019s sake, I have two of her substandard paintings in my apartment. It\u2019s obvious now you haven\u2019t been able to pin this on the stripper, so you\u2019re looking for a scapegoat. I will not be your scapegoat.\u201d Eve tried on some insulting patience\u2014and she believed she wore it better. \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have been stupid, Greg, and you were. So damn stupid.\u201d She rounded the table as his face splotched red with angry color, as she moved behind him. Leaned in, just a little. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have left the case, the tickets, the note. You should\u2019ve gotten rid of those. Nobody knew what was in that case but Erin, and you killed her. But you couldn\u2019t be sure, could you? Maybe Donna looked in it, because you sure as hell did.\u201d Now she leaned close to his ear, lowered her voice. \u201cAnd it burned you, burned hard. Maui? You couldn\u2019t take that insult. You were supposed to take Shauna there, on your honeymoon. That was the dream. How could you let this happen? Shauna had to suffer, too. She had to pay, too, for allowing it. \u201cBut then\u201d\u2014she straightened, met his eyes in the mirror\u2014\u201cyou always planned to kill Erin\u2014remove that obstacle. I think you hoped to kill her right before the wedding, but the whole Maui thing opened another door.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m with Becca.\u201d \u201cMaybe, maybe not. Either way, you couldn\u2019t be disrespected this way, couldn\u2019t have what you had smeared and defiled like this.\u201d She tapped the box as she walked around the table again. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t let this lesbian, this bohemian, this street artist who had sex with strippers lure Shauna into that life. You couldn\u2019t have Shaunbar defiled\u2014would you take it to defiled? Yeah, you would. Defile what you were, what you are.\u201d \u201cAnd Shauna wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d Peabody spoke quietly, in direct contrast to Eve. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t be manipulated and maneuvered this time. No matter how you tried to influence her, she resisted. Because of Erin. Because she loved her.\u201d \u201cShe did not! Erin manipulated her, maneuvered her, influenced her. Shauna in some sex club, dancing on a stage half-naked? Kissing another woman, and in public!\u201d \u201cThe horror,\u201d Peabody muttered. \u201cPlaying house with another woman? None of that, none is who she is. Erin twisted something in her. Oh, she could be charismatic, no question. Exciting, adventurous. It was a fling, one that went too far, but a fling. It would never have lasted, so I had no reason to kill Erin.\u201d \u201cYou did it for yourself.\u201d Eve sat back as she studied him. \u201cIt embarrassed you. It diminished you. And yeah, enraged you. Because you\u2019re a small, petty, stupid man.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a man!\u201d He shouted it. \u201cAnd you know nothing. Yes, their relationship embarrassed me. For Shauna. She was making a fool of herself. I actually said that to Becca once, and what did she say? She laughed, and said, \u2018A fool for love.\u2019 \u201cWomen are so predictable. Love is the reason, the excuse, the fall guy for everything.\u201d \u201cYou detested Erin.\u201d \u201cWhat if I did! She was ruining Shauna\u2019s future. She demeaned my past. We had something special, Shauna and I. Yes, we were young, but we had something special. We were something special, and what she was doing with Erin, what she intended to do with Erin despite all sense, demeaned what we had and what we were.\u201d \u201cYou were never going to give Shauna back that jewelry.\u201d \u201cSo what? So the fuck what? I gave it to her with an open heart. I took it back because she didn\u2019t deserve to have it.\u201d \u201cBecause of Erin.\u201d \u201cYes, because of fucking Erin. Maybe I\u2019m not as sorry as you think I should be that she\u2019s dead. But I didn\u2019t kill her. And you have nothing, absolutely nothing, to say I did.\u201d \u201cActually, we have this one thing. Because you\u2019re a stupid man, Greg. A stupid man who thinks he\u2019s smart. A small-minded, stupid man who believes he\u2019s special. You\u2019re not special. You\u2019re pitifully ordinary.\u201d \u201cFuck you. You have nothing.\u201d \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got this.\u201d Eve reached in the evidence box, pulled out the piano wire. \u201cSomething else you should\u2019ve ditched.\u201d His face paled, then reddened again. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before.\u201d \u201cWe found it in your drawer, Greg.\u201d \u201cThen you put it there. You\u2019ve probably planted evidence countless times, cheating to get where you are so you can strut around with your stunner and your ridiculous diamond and harass innocent people.\u201d \u201cEvery minute of the search is on record, and the recording is also in evidence.\u201d \u201cThen Becca must have put it there.\u201d \u201cWhoa.\u201d On a quick laugh, Eve sat back. \u201cYou\u2019re going to throw the woman you intend to marry under the maxibus.\u201d Eve shook her head. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re pitifully ordinary.\u201d \u201cAnd talk about predictable,\u201d Peabody added. \u201cPlus, more stupid.\u201d She tapped the package. \u201cThe name of the shop where you bought it\u2019s right here. And you weren\u2019t even smart enough to pay cash or go too far out of your own neighborhood to buy it. Then you fucking kept it. It took one goddamn \u2019link call to verify you bought it. \u201cWhat\u2019s below idiot, Peabody?\u201d \u201cI think moron.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s you, Greg. You\u2019re a moron. Tell us, why do you have piano wire in your drawer when you don\u2019t own a piano?\u201d A light sweat sheened that all-American face. This time when he fussed with his tie, he loosened the knot. \u201cIt\u2019s not against the law.\u201d \u201cJesus, do you honestly think we can\u2019t match this to the wound you put on Erin Albright\u2019s throat? What\u2019s below a moron?\u201d \u201cMaybe imbecile.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s getting there. A garrote\u2019s a mean way to kill, but she deserved it. So you bought the wire, and you looked up how to make a garrote. EDD\u2019s had time to go through your e\u2019s by now. Why don\u2019t you tag them up, Peabody, so we can close this out?\u201d \u201cStop it! Stop it! None of that proves anything.\u201d \u201cIf there\u2019s something below imbecile,\u201d Peabody said, \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll just say Greg Barney. You have the wire, you have a search for the fashioning of a garrote on your e\u2019s. You detested her. She demeaned who you were, and she was leading Shauna into a deplorable\u2014in your view\u2014lifestyle. \u201cAnd.\u201d She pulled the last bag out of evidence. \u201cYou kept your old \u2019link, Greg. We didn\u2019t need EDD to find your communications with Erin. She trusted you. She asked you for a favor, a favor she wanted so she could surprise Shauna. She didn\u2019t tell you what the surprise was\u2014that was her big secret.\u201d \u201cAnd you agreed. It\u2019s all on there,\u201d Peabody told him. \u201cWhen, you asked, where, and how. Such a good guy, such a good friend.\u201d \u201cThe when? The day of the party, because she didn\u2019t want Donna feeling pressured to get back in time. The where? She\u2019d bring it to you before you left for work\u2014after Becca had already left. Then the how. She\u2019d meet you when you took lunch, give you the swipe.\u201d \u201cI bet she told you not to peek, that she wanted Shauna to be the first to know. But you did, and that sealed Erin\u2019s fate.\u201d \u201cHell, it\u2019s like she asked you to kill her. She handed you the perfect opportunity.\u201d \u201cIf you had a friend who was hanging off the side of a cliff, would you throw her a rope?\u201d Barney demanded. \u201cIf you had a friend drowning because she\u2019d swum out too far, would you do what you could to save her?\u201d \u201cI would.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all I did. And in time she\u2019ll understand.\u201d \u201cNo, you did it for yourself, and you\u2019re glad she suffered, your good friend Shauna. So you could hover, the loving friend. Offer to make her a sandwich, offer to help get stuff out of her apartment, offer her a shoulder to cry on. \u201cThen smirk,\u201d Eve added. \u201cYeah, I caught that. Smirk when she gets her face slapped at her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s memorial. What a thrill for you. Her tears, her grief, a kind of payment for embarrassing you. For disrespecting the shine of Shaunbar.\u201d She shoved Erin\u2019s crime scene still across the table. \u201cThere\u2019s your work. I bet you\u2019re proud of it.\u201d \u201cI took a life to save a life. And I want a deal.\u201d \u201cI bet you do. Let\u2019s go over your movements of that day, that night, so we have all the details in place first.\u201d \n Epilogue It took time, and to her amazement, he didn\u2019t demand a lawyer until the end. She\u2019d given him too much credit for smarts. He ended up with a public defender who huddled with him, who then huddled with Reo. During the legal huddling, Eve dealt with the paperwork. Then she closed her murder book and began to clear her murder board. Then she huddled with Reo, and left satisfied, before she and Peabody went to deliver a different sort of notification. Shauna deserved to know. As a result, she drove through her home gates a little late. Not very, she decided, plus, she\u2019d followed the Marriage Rules and tagged Roarke as requested. She walked in, eyed Summerset, eyed the cat. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m late. And a stupid asshole of a murderer\u2019s in a cage.\u201d \u201cThen well done to you, Lieutenant.\u201d \u201cAs well done as the law allows,\u201d she said, and headed upstairs with the cat. When she walked into her office, Roarke was at her board, clearing it. \u201cYou\u2019re clearing my board.\u201d \u201cYou said it was done, so I thought I\u2019d save you some time.\u201d \u201cIt is, and it does. Thanks. Let\u2019s have some wine.\u201d She walked over to grab a bottle herself. Hardly mattered which, as Roarke didn\u2019t stock anything that didn\u2019t meet his level. And that remained well above hers. \u201cHe confessed?\u201d \u201cHe did. He\u2019s an idiot. No, wait, we decided he\u2019s a Greg Barney, which is below imbecile. You actually want to hear all this?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cThen let\u2019s sit over there, and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d She pointed toward the sofa, brought the wine and glasses herself. He\u2019d opened the terrace doors to the breeze that approached a wind. And it felt just fine. She ran through the interview. \u201cAnd that was it, truly? He murdered a woman because her relationship with his high school sweetheart embarrassed him?\u201d \u201cA lot of his self-worth\u2019s tied up in Shaunbar, and his incredibly rigid worldview. Shauna deviated from both, and he blamed Erin for it. His usual methods didn\u2019t work, so.\u201d She shook her head, drank. \u201cHe\u2019d have done it again.\u201d \u201cYou think so?\u201d \u201cI know it. If he\u2019d gotten away with this, he\u2019d have done it again. To Becca, maybe Shauna, a staff member who disrespected him. He\u2019ll get a shrink in prison, but I doubt they\u2019ll crack the wall of that worldview.\u201d \u201cDid he get a deal after all?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it much of a deal. Life, on-planet. Possibility of parole at twenty-five in.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re satisfied with that.\u201d \u201cYeah. He\u2019s in the system now, and he\u2019s not smart enough to work it inside. He\u2019s just not. He won\u2019t get parole at twenty-five.\u201d She stretched out her legs, put her boots on the table as the cat joined them. \u201cPushing his buttons turned out to be easier than I thought, and I didn\u2019t think it would be that difficult. Talking to Shauna, then Becca after? A lot harder.\u201d \u201cA kind of notification, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He topped off both their glasses, then put his boots beside hers. \u201cThe center drops out of someone\u2019s world.\u201d \u201cShauna\u2019d had enough time to work through at least some of it. But Becca? She loved the guy, but the guy she loved doesn\u2019t exist. Shauna wanted to go with us, and Angie got home when we were there. So they both went with us.\u201d \u201cSo Becca had a circle\u2014some of her tribe.\u201d \u201cIt helped. I guess it helped. When we left, they were packing up some of her things. She\u2019s going to stay at Angie\u2019s for a couple of days. I guess that helps, too.\u201d \u201cWe need our mates, in good times and in bad.\u201d \u201cYeah, I guess we do.\u201d \u201cDid you tell Crack?\u201d \u201cYeah, I felt he deserved to know. Which makes me think of Rochelle, and that leads to An Didean. Shauna understands I can\u2019t take that painting as a gift\u2014and the money from the sales of Erin\u2019s paintings is going to a scholarship for artists. She asked if I\u2019d find someone at An Didean for that particular amount.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s incredibly kind.\u201d \u201cShe sees it as a way to pay me back, and she doesn\u2019t have to pay me back for doing my job. But\u2014\u201d \u201cIt remains incredibly kind, and clever with it.\u201d He rubbed her thigh. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Rochelle, and she\u2019ll help you pick.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to pick. Don\u2019t make me pick. It\u2019s too much pressure. Can\u2019t she just pick? It\u2019s sort of part of her job.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right enough. That\u2019s the way we\u2019ll do it.\u201d \u201cGood. Whew. Feel the relief.\u201d She laid her head on his shoulder, then tipped her face up to kiss his jaw. \u201cLet\u2019s eat outside again.\u201d \u201cI could grill something.\u201d \u201cWould something be steak?\u201d \u201cIt could be.\u201d \u201cIt should be. But let\u2019s sit here and finish this glass first. With the doors open, it\u2019s practically outside. And it feels good, just sitting here.\u201d She linked her hand with his. \u201cIt\u2019s nice being married,\u201d she said again. \u201cMy idea, I\u2019ll remind you.\u201d \u201cI gotta give you that.\u201d She sat sipping wine, the strong summer breeze blowing in, her hand linked with his, and the cat spread over both their laps.
