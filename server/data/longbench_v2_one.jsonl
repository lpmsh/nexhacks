China\u2019s Court System and Reform Process\nInstitutional Basis of Court Reform in China\nAccording to the Constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the \nOrganic Law of the People\u2019s Courts of the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nthe people\u2019s courts, as judicial organs of the State, exercise adjudicative \npower in accordance with laws independently, free from any interference \nby administrative organs, social organizations, and individuals. The State \nsets up the Supreme People\u2019s Court, local people\u2019s courts at different levels \nand special people\u2019s courts such as military courts. In accordance with laws, \nthese people\u2019s courts adjudicate civil, criminal and administrative cases and \nother cases prescribed by laws, and carry out judicial activities including the \nexecution of civil and administrative decisions. Sole judges, collegial panels, \njudicial committees, and compensation committees are the judicial organs \nprescribed by laws.\nThe Supreme People\u2019s Court, as the highest judicial organ of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, is responsible for adjudicating various cases that have \nmaterial effects nationwide or are subject to its adjudication according to \nlaw, formulating judicial interpretations, supervising and guiding the judicial \nwork of local people\u2019s courts at different levels and special people\u2019s courts, \nand managing certain judicial administration work of the courts nationwide \nwithin the scope of its functions and powers as per laws.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   68\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n69\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nLocal people\u2019s courts at different levels include primary people\u2019s courts, \nintermediate people\u2019s courts and higher people\u2019s courts. Special people\u2019s \ncourts include military courts, maritime courts, IP courts, financial courts, \netc.\nA people\u2019s court at a higher level supervises the judicial work of the people\u2019s \ncourts at the next lower level. In litigious activities, the people\u2019s courts adopt \nthe systems of public trial, collegiate panel, challenge, people\u2019s assessors, \ndefense, and judgment of the second instance as final, etc.\nBasic Process of Court Reform in China\nSince the introduction of the reform and opening-up policy, along with \nall-round economic and social development, continuous advancement of \ndemocracy and rule by law, and the public\u2019s ever-increasing demands for \nand expectations of judicature, the original judicial system has become \nunable to meet the need of new situations. As early as in the 1990s, China\u2019s \ncourts started the reforms focusing on enhancing the function of court trials, \nexpanding the openness of trials and improving judicial professionalization. \nSince the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (\u201cCPC\u201d), \nthe Supreme People\u2019s Court has initiated a series of reforms in the areas \nof organization and system of courts, judge system, litigation procedure, \nmethod of trial, enforcement system, judicial management, etc., and \npromulgated three \u201cFive-year Reform Program for People\u2019s Courts\u201d in 1999, \n2005 and 2009 respectively. The said three Programs served as the basis of \nChina\u2019s court reform before 2013.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   69\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n70\n-\n-\nThe Decision of the Central Committee of the CPC (\u201cCCCPC\u201d) on Some \nMajor Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform adopted \nat the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th CCCPC set an important task of \nadvancing rule by law in China and deepening the reform of the judicial \nsystem. The Decision of the CCCPC on Some Major Issues Concerning \nManagement of State Affairs under the Rule of Law in an All-round Way \nadopted at the 4th Plenary Session of the 18th CCCPC set the establishment \nof a socialist system of rule by law with Chinese characteristics and the \nbuilding of a socialist country under the rule of law as the general objective \nof advancing management of state affairs under the rule of law in an all-\nround way, and put forward a series of major reform measures in scientific \nlegislation, strict law enforcement, judicial impartiality, universal law \nabiding and other areas. The judicial reform has become an important \ncomponent of the program of comprehensively deepening the reform in \nChina and has been included in the overall development strategy of the \nState.\nIn order to further deepening the reform of people\u2019s courts, the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court promulgated the Opinions on Comprehensively Deepening \nthe Reform of People\u2019s Courts on February 4, 2015, putting forward 65 \nreform measures, which was served as the Fourth Five-year Reform \nProgram for People\u2019s Courts 2014-2018. As of the end of 2018, 65 reform \ntasks had been carried out in an all-round way, 256 reform documents had \nbeen formulated. Among these reform documents, 173 were issued by the \nSupreme People\u2019s Court separately, 46 were issued by it jointly with the \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   70\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n71\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nrelated departments of the Central Government, and 37 were formulated \nwith its promotion or participation.\nAt the 19th National Congress of the CPC, major strategic arrangement was \nmade as follows: \u201cdeepening the comprehensive and supporting reform of \nthe judicial system and fully implementing the judicial accountability system \nso that people can experience fairness and justice in each case\u201d, which \nmarks a new stage of the judicial system reform. Based on the realities of \ncourts, the Supreme People\u2019s Court formulated the Opinions on Deepening \nthe Comprehensive and Supporting Reform of the Judicial System in the \nPeople\u2019s Courts, namely the Fifth Five-Year Reform Program for People\u2019s \nCourts 2019-2023 as an important program for instructing the people\u2019s \ncourts to deepen the comprehensive and supporting reform of the judicial \nsystem in the next five years.\nOrganization and Implementation of the Court Reform in China\nIn early 2014, China set up the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively \nDeepening Reform headed by President Xi Jinping, which is responsible \nfor the overall design, arrangement, coordination, promotion and \nimplementation of the reform. In March 2018, it was renamed as the \nCentral Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission. Between \nJanuary 22, 2014 and December 31, 2018, the Central Leading Group for \nComprehensively Deepening Reform (hereinafter referred to as \u201cCLGCDR\u201d) \nand the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission \n(hereinafter referred to as \u201cCCDRC\u201d), in aggregate, held 45 meetings, \nconsidered and passed 35 documents relating to important reforms of \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   71\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n72\n-\n-\npeople\u2019s courts.\nThe CCDRC has six special sub-groups, which are responsible for \nconsidering important issues relating to reforms in the relevant areas, \ncoordinating and advancing the formulation and implementation of special \nreform policies and measures. The Leading Group for Reform of the Social \nSystem (also called Central Leading Group for Reform of the Judicial \nSystem) is responsible for deepening the reform of the judicial system.\nThe reform of the judicial system covers a wide range of issues and has \nhigh policy sensitivity. In consideration that the improvement of classified \nmanagement of judicial personnel, improvement of judicial accountability, \nimprovement of job security of judicial personnel and promotion of \ncentralized management of personnel, financial and material resources of \nlocal courts below the provincial level are basic measures of the reform \nof the judicial system, according to the principle that major reforms shall \nbe first conducted on a pilot basis, China launched pilot reforms in respect \nof the aforesaid four issues in some provinces, autonomous regions and \nmunicipalities directly under the Central Government in three batches, to \naccumulate experience for advancing the reform in an all-round way. Since \nJune 2014, the first judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in 7 \nprovinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, namely \nShanghai, Jilin, Hubei, Guangdong, Hainan, Guizhou, and Qinghai. Since \nJune 2015, the second judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in \n11 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central \nGovernment, namely Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   72\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n73\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nZhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Shandong, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Ningxia. Since \nMarch 2016, the third judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in \nBeijing and other 13 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly \nunder the Central Government and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region \nProduction and Construction Corps. Since July 2016, these four major \nreforms have been implemented nationwide in an all-round way. \nThe Supreme People\u2019s Court set up a leading group for judicial reform \nheaded by Chief Judge Zhou Qiang, responsible for organizing, leading, \narranging, and coordinating the judicial reform of courts, holding plenary \nand special meetings, overall planning of key issues of reform, considering \nreform proposals, discussing and deciding on major issues. Each higher \npeople\u2019s court sets up a leading group for judicial reform, responsible for \nsupervising, guiding, arranging, and coordinating the judicial reform of \ncourts within its jurisdiction. Each higher people\u2019s court\u2019s proposal of pilot \nprogram for judicial reform is subject to examination and approval by the \nSupreme People\u2019s Court, and if it involves any major reform, by the Central \nGovernment.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   73\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n74\n-\n-\nII. Fully Implementing the Judicial Accountability System\nIt is both an objective requirement of the law of justice and a core content \nof the reform of the judicial system that one who tries a case shall have the \npower to decide the case and be responsible for his decision. In September \n2015, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued certain opinions on improving \nthe judicial accountability system in the people\u2019s courts, establishing a \nnew type of operating mechanism of adjudicative power, to instruct the \ncourts nationwide to advance the reform of the judicial accountability \nsystem. In December 2018, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued opinions on \nfurther comprehensively implementing the judicial accountability system, \nproviding more guidance on issues such as improving the mechanism of \ntrial supervision and management and the mechanism of unified application \nof law, to promote full implementation of the judicial accountability \nsystem. Since the full implementation of the judicial accountability system \nreform, in courts nationwide, the number of first-line judicial personnel has \nincreased over 20%, the average number of cases handled by each person \nhas increased over 20%, and the rate of conclusion of cases has increased \nover 18%.\nImplementing accountability system for sole judges and collegiate \npanels handling cases. Fully respecting the status of sole judges and \ncollegiate panels as statutory judicial organs, most of the courts at all levels \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   74\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n75\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nhave established an accountability system in which \u201cone who tries a case \nshall have the power to decide the case and be responsible for his decision\u201d, \nand have revoked the system of asking for instructions and examination and \napproval level by level. The written judgments formed through adjudication \nby collegiate panels or sole judges are issued upon signature by collegiate \npanel members or sole judges. Except the cases considered and decided \nby the judicial committees, court/tribunal presidents no longer review or \nsign the written judgments on the cases of which they have not directly \nparticipated in the trial. Since the reform, in courts nationwide, the number \nof cases on which the judgments are directly made by sole judges and \ncollegiate panels has reached over 98% of the total number of cases, and \nthe number of cases referred to judicial committees for discussion has fallen \nsharply. In Shanghai, since the launch of the reform, the ratio of the cases \ndirectly decided by the sole judges or collegiate panels has reached 99.99%, \nand only 0.1% of the cases concluded have been submitted to the judicial \ncommittees for discussion.\nFlexibly organizing the judicial team. According to laws and based \non actual circumstances, the primary people\u2019s courts organize judicial \nteams with judge as the core member, and judge assistant, clerk and other \nauxiliary judicial personnel as the supporting members, describe the duties \nof judges, judge assistants and clerks, and improve the case handling \nmechanism with clear power and responsibility, consistency between power \nand responsibility, both division and cooperation, and orderly operation, \nby taking into overall consideration the separation of complicated cases \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   75\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n76\n-\n-\nfrom simple ones and the specialization of adjudication. By following the \nidea of separating complicated cases from simple ones, Chaoyang District \nPeople\u2019s Court in Beijing has organized 26 quick-track sentencing teams \nfor simple cases, each of which concludes over 650 cases annually, and \n45 specialized judicial teams for finance, intellectual property rights, real \nestate, bankruptcy and other meticulous trial of complicated cases, which \nhave fairly tried a large number of major doubtful and complicated cases. \nFutian District People\u2019s Court in Shenzhen, Guangdong, has created a new \nmode of organizing judicial team as follows: in a quick-track sentencing, \nquick trial and quick enforcement team, each judge is supported by multiple \nassistants; in an ordinary judicial team, there are 3 relatively fixed basic \ncase-handling units, each of which consists of 1 judge and 2 assistants, so \nthat the judicial team is both stable and flexible and the judicial resources \nallocation is optimized. In 2018, all kinds of judicial teams in this court \nconcluded 107,301 cases, with a YoY increase of 16.32%, and the quality \nand efficiency of trial continuously improved.\nReforming the case allocation mechanism. The courts at all levels have \nestablished a case allocation mechanism where random allocation plays a \nmajor role and assignment a supporting role. Cases are randomly allocated \nto judges based on the area and complexity of cases. If the judge handling \na case needs to be replaced due to challenge or due to job transfer, health, \nrisk of corruption, etc., the replacement is subject to review and approval \nby relevant court/tribunal president, and the replacement result shall be \nnotified to the litigants in a timely manner and made public on the working \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   76\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:01\n\n\n77\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nplatform. The courts in Shanghai have formulated guidelines on random and \nautomated allocation of cases and has realized random allocation of civil \nand commercial cases. The Suburb People\u2019s Court in Sanya, Hainan has \nintroduced an automated case allocation system, whereby, after scientifically \npresetting saturated workload of judges, cases are randomly allocated \nupon automated calculation of workload based on case-handling quota \nand unconcluded cases of judges, to address the problem of unbalanced \nallocation of cases through informatization.\nInnovating the auxiliary trial work mode. The courts at all levels \nhave organized work teams specializing in service of process, property \npreservation, enforcement examination and control, document uploading, \nonline announcement and other affairs. They manage auxiliary trial affairs \nin a centralized way to improve work efficiency. The courts in Beijing, \nShanghai, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong, etc. actively explore ways of \nhandling notice service, material scanning, file filing and other auxiliary \naffairs by purchasing social services, to improve the efficiency of handling \ncases with the aid of external service providers. Shenzhen Intermediate \nPeople\u2019s Court in Guangdong has formulated guidelines on courts\u2019 purchase \nof social services, setting out the scope, procedures, and standards for courts \nto purchase social services, and listing seven categories of 41 services which \nmay be outsourced in litigation service, adjudication and enforcement, \ncourt management, logistics support, judicial transparency, informatization, \nculture construction, and other areas. In 2018, by outsourcing mediation \nassistance service, it successfully mediated 15,829 disputes before litigation; \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   77\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n78\n-\n-\nby using social services, it scanned hard-copy materials and generated soft-\ncopy ones of over 200,000 cases, constantly improving the efficiency of \nhandling cases. Siming District People\u2019s Court and Lujiang Notary Public \nOffice in Xiamen, Fujian has created the first litigation-notary collaborative \ninnovation center in China, clarifying that notary offices may assist people\u2019s \ncourts with procedural and auxiliary judicial services.\nImproving the mechanism for regular handling of cases by court/\ntribunal presidents. The courts nationwide have implemented the judge \nquota system. According to the requirements that registered judges must \nhandle cases, the presidents (including vice presidents) of courts/tribunals \nat all levels generally engage again in trial work upon registration as judge. \nIn April 2017, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued guidelines on further \npromoting the presidents of courts/tribunals at all levels registered as judges \nto handle cases, establishing a mechanism for strict constraint, evaluation \nand supervision on case-handling by court/tribunal presidents and improving \nthe mechanism for court officials mainly to adjudicate major doubtful and \ncomplicated cases, to give full play to the exemplary and leading role of \ncourt/tribunal presidents in handling cases. In 2018, in Jiangsu, the number \nof cases adjudicated by court/tribunal presidents as handling judge or chief \njudge accounted for 50.84% of the total number of cases before the courts \nacross the province. \nImproving the new trial management and supervision mechanism. In \nApril 2017, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued opinions on implementation \nof the judicial accountability system and improvement of the trial \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   78\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n79\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nsupervision and management mechanism to instruct the courts at all levels \nto improve the new supervision and management system. The courts at all \nlevels have formulated a list of powers and responsibilities of court/tribunal \npresidents and related regulations to set out the scope and method for court/\ntribunal presidents to exercise their power to supervise and manage trials, \nand to actively build a supervision and management mechanism covering \nthe entire court, all staff, and whole process through informatization. The \ncourt/tribunal presidents may only express their opinions on specific cases \npublicly through professional judge meetings and the judicial committee, \nand such opinions shall be wholly recorded on the working platform, so that \npowers are delegated without indulgence and exercised under supervision. \nThe courts in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Sichuan and other regions, by \nrelying on artificial intelligence and big data, explore how to achieve online \nsupervision through automated recognition, labeling, system recommending, \nnode control, authority freezing and other means. Tianjin Higher People\u2019s \nCourt issued 29 categories of judicial standards in four batches covering \nadjudication process, power exercise, judicial transparency, litigation service \nand other areas. Chengdu Intermediate People\u2019s Court in Sichuan, by closely \ncentering on five major links of case filing, adjudication, conclusion, appeal, \nand enforcement, and relying on online working platform, has achieved \nsilent supervision on 183 work nodes and 68 monitoring nodes, in order to \nassist judges in handling cases.\nImproving the chief judge meeting system. Most of the courts at all levels \nhave established the chief judge meeting system to provide judges with \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   79\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n80\n-\n-\nadvice on correct application of law and provide opinions for reference by \ncollegiate panels. In December 2018, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued \nguidelines on improving the working mechanism of chief judge meetings \nin people\u2019s courts to improve the rules of procedure of professional judge \nmeetings. Chongqing No. 2 Intermediate People\u2019s Court has established \nthe systems of joint meeting of judges in the tribunals and the cross-\ndepartmental meeting of judges, with the number of cases submitted to \nthe judicial committee for discussion being reduced by 42% year on year, \nthereby giving full play to the service and consultation functions of the \nmeetings of judges and the function of filtration of the cases submitted to the \njudicial committee for discussion.\nReforming the system of judicial committee. The Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt has formulated guidelines to strengthen the function of the judicial \ncommittees in summarizing experience in adjudication, unifying the \napplication of law and discussing and deciding on major issues in respect of \nadjudication.

Advancing the Reform of Organizational Structure of \nCourts\nImproving an optimized, coordinated and efficient organizational system \nand functional system of courts is an important part and goal of the \njudicial reform of the people\u2019s courts, and an important support for the \nmodernization of judicial system and judicial capability. Since 2013, China\u2019s \ncourts have actively promoted the reform of organizational system and \ninternal organs of courts, optimized the jurisdiction and power allocation, \nand promoted the combination of specialized trials and flat management, \nlaying a solid foundation for serving the big picture, exercising judicial \npower for the people, and judicial impartiality.\nSetting up Circuit Courts of the Supreme People\u2019s Court. At the end \nof January 2015, the Supreme People\u2019s Court set up No. 1 and 2 Circuit \nCourts in Shenzhen and Shenyang respectively; at the end of December \n2016, it set up No. 3, 4, 5 and 6 Circuit Courts in Nanjing, Zhengzhou, \nChongqing and Xi\u2019an respectively. These Circuit Courts of the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court, as standing local judicial organs dispatched by the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court, adjudicate the cases assigned by the Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt according to law. The judgments and rulings made by these Circuit \nCourts have the equal effect as those made by the Supreme People\u2019s Court. \nSince their establishment and as of the end of 2018, the six Circuit Courts \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   86\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n87\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nhave concluded 33,335 cases, accounting for 50.35% of the total number \nof cases concluded by the Supreme People\u2019s Court, and have received a \ntotal of 117,090 visitors who brought complaints and appeals before them \nand resolved relevant disputes before litigation. By vigorously carrying out \nthe circuit adjudication and actively innovating working mechanism, these \nCircuit Courts have effectively realized the original intention to delegate the \nadjudicative power, facilitate initiation of lawsuits by the people, improved \nwork efficiency, effectively promoted social harmony and stability, and \nserved and protected the rule of law in respective circuits, thus being \nnicknamed by the people as the \u201csupreme people\u2019s court at the doorstep\u201d, \nplaying an important role in improving the socialist judicial system with \nChinese characteristics and promoting the rule of law in a comprehensive \nmanner.\nEnhancing the construction of a specialized IP judicial system. In order \nto further enhance judicial protection of intellectual property rights (IP) \nand unifying the adjudicative criteria for IP cases, with the approval by \nthe Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, IP courts were \nestablished in Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai on November 6, December \n16 and December 28, 2014 respectively. The Supreme People\u2019s Court has \nissued the relevant judicial interpretations, defining the jurisdiction of IP \ncourts over cases, and providing guidelines on the appointment of IP judges, \nparticipation in litigious activities by technological investigation officers of \nIP courts and other issues. The IP courts have built a new image of China \nin judicial protection of IP through fair adjudication of typical cases, timely \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   87\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n88\n-\n-\npublication of typical cases and otherwise. As of the end of 2018, these \nthree IP courts had accepted a total of 90,578 cases and concluded 74,007 \ncases. In addition, the Supreme People\u2019s Court has also promoted the \nestablishment of 19 IP courts in 16 provinces and cities such as Jiangsu, in \norder to realize centralized jurisdiction over some IP cases across regions. \nOn January 1, 2019, the IP Tribunal of the Supreme People\u2019s Court, which \nwas established according to the decision of the Standing Committee of the \nNational People\u2019s Congress, was officially opened, for unified adjudication \nof highly professional and technical civil and administrative appeals such \nas those involving patent, to form a national mechanism for adjudicating IP \nappeals. The above-mentioned reform measures have effectively promoted \nthe specialized adjudication of, centralized jurisdiction over, and intensified \nprocedures for IP cases, and improved the IP judicial system with Chinese \ncharacteristics.\nLaunching pilot reform of trans-regional courts in Beijing and \nShanghai. In order to ensure lawful and fair adjudication of trans-regional \ncases, the Beijing No. 4 Intermediate People\u2019s Court and the Shanghai No. \n3 Intermediate People\u2019s Court were established in Beijing and Shanghai \nrespectively in December 2014, as pilot trans-regional people\u2019s courts, \nthrough which experience has been accumulated in exploring how to establish \na new pattern of litigation system in which general cases are adjudicated \nat local courts and special cases are adjudicated at trans-regional courts. \nThese two courts are responsible for adjudicating major civil, commercial, \nadministrative, environmental and resource protection, food and drug safety \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   88\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n89\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nand certain criminal cases involving different administrative regions, to \nensure fair adjudication of cases involving local interests. From 2015 to \n2018, the number of first-instance administrative cases brought against a \ndistrict/county government and subject to the centralized jurisdiction of \nand accepted by the Beijing No. 4 Intermediate People\u2019s Court increased \nby 650%. As appointed by the Supreme People\u2019s Court, from October 26, \n2017, this court began to accept the appeals of environmental-protection \nadministrative cases adjudicated by relevant courts in Tianjin, marking \nan important step in cross-provincial jurisdiction of cases. The number of \nadministrative cases accepted by the Shanghai No. 3 Intermediate People\u2019s \nCourt increases by over 30% per year. In 2018, the number of settled and \ndropped administrative cases before this court increased by 126.67% over \nthe previous year. These two trans-regional courts have fairly adjudicated a \nseries of cases with major social impacts, effectively addressing the issue of \n\u201cat home v. away in litigation\u201d and enhancing the public credibility of the \njudiciary.\nSetting up Shanghai Financial Court. According to the decision of the \nStanding Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, on August 20, \n2018, Shanghai Financial Court was formally established with special \njurisdiction over finance-related civil-commercial cases and finance-related \nadministrative cases subject to the jurisdiction of an Intermediate People\u2019s \nCourt. The Supreme People\u2019s Court has issued judicial interpretations, \nclarifying the specific jurisdiction of the Shanghai Financial Court. As of \nthe end of 2018, Shanghai Financial Court had accepted 1,897 cases, with a \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   89\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n90\n-\n-\ntotal subject value of RMB 25.2 billion, mainly involving disputes related \nto liability for misrepresentation as to securities, financial loan contracts, \ncorporate bond trading, repurchase of pledged securities, financial leasing \ncontracts, for-profit trust, etc.\nSetting up Internet courts in Hangzhou, Beijing and Guangzhou. \nInternet court is a major institutional innovation whereby China\u2019s courts \nactively address the judicial needs in the Internet era and implement the \nInternet power strategy. On August 18, 2017, September 9, 2018, and \nSeptember 28, 2018, Hangzhou Internet Court, Beijing Internet Court, and \nGuangzhou Internet Court were successively established. In September \n2018, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued judicial interpretations of trials \nbefore Internet courts, clarifying the jurisdiction, appeal mechanism, online \nlitigation rules, and requirements for construction of litigation platform \nof Internet Courts. Internet Courts have actively promoted the \u201conline \nresolution of online disputes\u201d and facilitated the online verification of \nlitigant\u2019s identity, online collection of evidentiary materials, online service \nof legal instruments, etc., thus significantly improving judicial efficiency. \nIn Hangzhou Internet Court, the online case-filing rate has reached 89.2%, \nthe online court-session rate has reached 59.9%, the online case-concluding \nrate has reached 83.6%, the online trial session has averaged 28 minutes, \nand the trial period has averaged 41 days, saving 60% and 50% of the time \nrespectively compared with the traditional trial mode.

Strengthening the System and Mechanism of Judicial \nProtection of Human Rights\nTo respect and protect human rights is an important principle set forth in the \nConstitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and an important content \nof the socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics. China\u2019s courts \nhave achieved positive results in the development of the mechanism of \njudicial protection of human rights through pushing forward the reform of \nthe criminal litigation system centering on trials, strictly implementing the \nlegal principles that crimes shall be punished only under the law, judgments \nshall be made upon evidence and presuming innocent until proven guilty, \nactively preventing cases in which people are unjustly, falsely or wrongly \ncharged or sentenced, protecting the lawyers\u2019 right to practice according \nto law, achieving positive results in building the mechanism of judicial \nprotection of human rights.\nPushing forward the reform of the criminal litigation system centering \non trials. The Supreme People\u2019s Court, in conjunction with the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of \nState Security and the Ministry of Justice, issued the guidelines on pushing \nforward the reform of the criminal litigation system centering on trials and \nthe documents on strictly excluding illegal evidence in handling of criminal \ncases.

In these exemplary court trials, a total of 1,469 witnesses, including \n818 general witnesses, 114 appraisers, 455 investigators, 17 experts, and \n65 victims, testified before courts. Wenzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court in \nZhejiang has improved the mechanism for protecting personnel testifying \nbefore court, issued detailed rules on investigators\u2019 appearance in court \nas witnesses, provided remote rooms for offering testimonies, devices for \nconcealing faces of witnesses and other appropriate facilities, established the \nmechanism for protecting the rights and interests of witnesses in conjunction \nwith the public security and procuratorial organs, and formulated the \nstandard of subsidies for witnesses testifying before court.

With the authorization of the Standing Committee \nof the National People\u2019s Congress, since August 26, 2014, China has \nlaunched a two-year pilot reform on quick-track sentencing procedure for \ncriminal cases in 217 primary courts in Beijing and 17 other cities. During \nthe period of the pilot reform, the pilot courts tried and concluded 52,540 \ncriminal cases using the quick-track sentencing procedure, involving 54,572 \ndefendants in total, accounting for 35.88% of criminal cases in which not \nmore than one-year sentences were pronounced by such pilot courts in the \nsame period, and 18.48% of the criminal cases tried by such pilot courts \nin the same period; among such cases, 95.35% were concluded within 10 \ndays, 65.04 percent higher than those subject to the summary procedure, and \nthe judgments on 96.05% of such cases were announced at the court, 41.22 \npercent higher than those subject to the summary procedure. Haidian District \nPeople\u2019s Court in Beijing has explored the mode of whole-course quick-track \nsentencing procedure to effectively reduce the time of circulation of cases \nat all the stages. Under the said mode, the average duration of the judicial \nprocedure in which the defendants were under detention was 33 days, about \n70% shorter than that of the similar cases concluded using the summary \nprocedure prior to the reform. Among all the cases subject to the quick-track \nsentencing procedure, the rate of plaintiffs filing appeals who also lodged \ncivil lawsuits was 0, the rate of defendants filing appeals was 2.01%, the rate \nof procuratorial organs filing protests was only 0.01%, and the overall rate \nof filing appeals or protests was 9.52 percent lower than that of the criminal \ncases taken as a whole.

Through shortening pre-trial detention and passing sentences on \ndefendants quickly and leniently, the quick-track sentencing procedure can \ngive full play to the function of social correction, and help the offenders \nreform themselves and return to the society. In September 2016, the 22nd \nSession of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People\u2019s Congress \nreviewed a report on the pilot reform, fully affirmed the efforts in these \npilot reforms, and decided to incorporate the pilot reform of quick-track \nsentencing procedure for criminal cases into the pilot reform of imposing \nlenient penalties on those who admit their guilt and accept punishments \nand to continue the pilot reform. Between September 2016 and September \n2018, a total of 281 pilot courts was identified, and 205,510 criminal cases \nwere concluded by applying the system of imposing lenient penalties on \nthose who admit their guilt and accept punishments, accounting for 53.5% \nof the criminal cases concluded by the pilot courts during this period. On \nOctober 26, 2018, at the 6th Session of the Standing Committee of the 13th \nNational People\u2019s Congress, a decision was made on amending the Criminal \nProcedure Law to incorporate the achievements made in the pilot reform \nof imposing lenient penalties on those who admit their guilt and accept \npunishments into the newly amended Criminal Procedure Law and promote \nthem nationwide.\nDeepening the reform on standardization of sentencing. At the end \nof 2013, the Supreme People\u2019s Court promulgated the guidelines on \nmeasurement of penalty by people\u2019s courts to regulate the judges\u2019 discretion \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   98\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n99\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nin measurement of penalty, which require setting up an independent debate \nprocedure regarding measurement of penalty, and promoting standardization \nof measurement of penalty throughout the country. In 2016, the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court further extended the kinds of charges and punishments under \nthe pilot program on standardization of measurement of penalty by including \ndangerous driving and other seven charges into the scope of application of \nthe pilot program and extending the kinds of punishment from imprisonment \nand criminal detention to fines and probation. The Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt designated some courts to carry out the pilot program to ensure the \nstandardization of measurement of penalty and the punishment meted out \nbeing appropriate to the crime committed. With this reform implemented, \nthe methodology in sentencing has become more standardized and scientific, \nand the sentences received have become fairer and more balanced, bringing \nabout a procedure with more transparency and fairness. \nStrictly regulating commutation of punishment, parole and temporary \nexecution of sentences outside prison. In April 2014, the Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt issued the judicial interpretations regarding the hearing procedures \nfor commutation of punishment and parole, requiring establishment of the \nsystem of public hearing on commutation of punishment and parole and the \nsystem of periodic publication of typical cases. In 2015, the information \nwebsite on the cases of commutation of punishment, parole and temporary \nexecution of sentences outside prison granted by the courts nationwide was \nopened, to publicize the information of the whole process from case filing \nto judgment entering of the cases involving commutation of punishment and \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   99\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:02\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n100\n-\n-\nparole, so that commutation of punishment and parole is conducted under \nthe supervision of the public.

As of the end of 2018, the courts nationwide had publicized \n12.88 million blacklisted dishonest persons, out of which 17.46 million \nreservations of air tickets and 5.47 million of bullet train or high-speed rail \ntickets were rejected. 3.51 million dishonest persons subject to enforcement \nhave fulfilled their obligations under such pressure.\nPromoting online judicial auctions. In order to overcome the shortcomings \nof conventional auction methods, the Supreme People\u2019s Court, absorbing \nand distilling the experiences of online judicial auctions in lower courts,  has \nestablished a new judicial auction mode that online auctions are general and \ntraditional auctions are exceptional, and promulgated judicial interpretations \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   122\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n123\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nregarding online judicial auctions, requiring full promotion of online judicial \nauctions nationwide and improvement of related supporting systems from \nJanuary 1, 2017. Up to now, 92.5% of the courts nationwide (namely 3,260 \ncourts) have fully adopted online auctions, and over 80% of the judicial \nauctions have been conducted online. Owing to the implementation of \nonline judicial auctions, the successful auction rate and premium rate have \nincreased exponentially, and the rate of failed auction and price reduction as \nwell as the auction costs has dropped significantly. Online actions effectively \neliminate the rent-seeking probabilities, cut off the illegal interest chain, \nand bring about \u201czero complaint\u201d about violation of laws and disciplines \nduring auctions. From its launch in March 2017 to December 2018, the \ncourts nationwide have conducted over 940,000 online auctions and thereby \nsold over 270,000 items for RMB 604.9 billion, with successful auction rate \nof 70.8% and premium rate of 64.3%, and saving commissions of RMB \n18.6 billion for litigants. To tackle the low efficiency of appraisal during \njudicial auctions, courts nationwide have diversified methods of appraisal \nsuch as bargaining between litigants, targeted inquiries, online inquiries \nand entrusted appraisals, and have established a unified online appraisal \nplatform. With appraisals becoming more standardized and informatized, \nthe efficiency of property disposal has been improved and the burden on \nlitigants has been alleviated.\nImproving the management of enforcements. Since 2013, the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court has been striving for a normative enforcement system, and \nhas promulgated 55 judicial interpretations and regulatory documents in this \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   123\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n124\n-\n-\nregard. In particular, since 2016, 37 judicial interpretations and regulatory \ndocuments regulating property preservation, property investigation, \nenforcement settlement, enforcement guaranty, presupposed arbitration \nand other issues have been promulgated to strengthen the system, reify the \nrules, and effectively restrain and regulate the enforcement-related power. \nSince 2014, the courts nationwide have carried out a comprehensive check \non the enforcement cases pending in the past 20 years, and entered over \n16 million cases into the enforcement case management system, laying \na solid foundation for an orderly, precise, comprehensive and intelligent \nmanagement of the enforcement cases. A new mode of enforcement \nmanagement has been established to put all courts in this country under \n\u201cunified management, unified coordination, and unified command\u201d, \ntransforming the management into a new flat structure being more \nintensified, visualized, standardized, and intelligent. A unified enforcement \ncase handling platform has been established so that all the enforcement \nofficers nationwide work on the same platform, harmonizing the standards \nand procedures for enforcement cases, and strengthening the control over \nkey nodes. An unified enforcement command and management platform \nhas been established. With its nearly 20 functions including enforcement \ncoordination, property management, complaints and appeals, and proceeding \nsupervision, this platform realized the progress that enforcement information \ncan be publicized at \u201cone-stop\u201d and case handling can be pressed via \u201cone-\nclick\u201d. In response to the difficulties in overseeing the handling of letters \nand visits involving enforcement, the unified system also included all the \ninformation of letters and visits involving enforcement, through which the \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   124\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n125\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nentire process of handling is recorded, traceable, and managed precisely.\nDeepening the reform of the enforcement system and mechanisms. \nThe pilot reform of the separation of adjudication power and enforcement \npower within the people\u2019s courts has been advanced actively and steadily. \nThe Supreme People\u2019s Court has promulgated opinions on improving \ncoordination of case filing, adjudication and enforcement, in order to \nstrengthen the interactive engagements between case filing, adjudication, \nenforcement and preservation procedures. A team-based working structure \nhas been established with judges as the team leader and legal assistants, \nclerks, judicial police and other auxiliary judicial personnel as the supporting \nmembers, which maximizes the utility of human resources for enforcement. \nThe practice that property preservation applicants obtain insurance from \nprofessional insurers has been comprehensively promoted, which backs \napplicants struggling to provide collaterals and contributes to the increase of \napplications of property preservation measures. In response to the deficit of \nthe judicial assistance fund, the Supreme People\u2019s Court, on the basis of the \napproved pilot projects in Ningbo courts, has explored methods to expand \nthe capital source, such as insuring the judicial assistance funds. In 2018, the \ngranted judicial assistance fund amounted to RMB 650 million.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   125\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n126\n-\n-\nVII. Deepening Judicial Openness and Judicial Democracy\nOpenness is the best means of anti-corruption. Since 2013, according \nto an overall integrated arrangement, by upholding to the principle of \nlegality, voluntary, comprehensive  and substantive disclosure, the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court has been simultaneously promoting the construction of four \ndisclosure platforms for judicial process, court trials, written judgments, \nand enforcement procedures to improve judicial openness and transparency. \nUnder the principle that disclosure is the general rule unless it meets the \nexceptional conditions defined by law, it has been promoting judicial \nopenness in all areas and at all links of the adjudication and enforcement by \nthe people\u2019s courts to ensure that all contents that should be disclosed and \ndelivered to the public properly. In November 2018, the Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt promulgated opinions on further deepening judicial openness to \ncontinuously expand the breadth and depth of judicial openness.\nPromoting the openness of judicial process. In November 2014, the China \nJudicial Process Information Online was officially opened. Now, it has \nbecome a platform for centralized gathering and unified publishing of the \ninformation about the judicial process of the courts nationwide, providing \n\u201cone-stop\u201d disclosure service to the parties to the cases adjudicated by the \ncourts nationwide.

The items of the \npilot program includes, among other things, reforming the requirements for \nthe appointment of people\u2019s assessors, improving the mode of appointment \nof people\u2019s assessors, expanding the scope of participation in trials, defining \nthe powers to participate in trials, enhancing job security, establishing \nthe withdrawal mechanism, giving full play to the advantage of people\u2019s \nassessors in being familiar with the social situations and public opinions, \nand gradually realizing the goal that people\u2019s assessors no longer vote on \nissues relating to the application of law and only participate in the finding \nof facts. In order to further address the problems arising in the pilot reform, \nin April 2017, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress \ndecided to extend the pilot period by one year.

Promoting Scientific and Classified Management over \nJudicial Personnel\nAccording to the overall arrangement by the State and in cooperation with \nrelated departments of the Central Government, the Supreme People\u2019s Court \nhas fully reformed the judicial personnel management system. \nEstablishing a system for classified management of judicial personnel. \nIn response to the problem that the past judicial personnel management \nsystem did not fully reflect the characteristics of the judicial profession, \nthe Supreme People\u2019s Court has actively promoted the reform of the \nsystem for classified management of judicial personnel, by classifying the \njudicial personnel into judges, auxiliary judicial personnel and judicial \nadministrative personnel, and adopting different management systems for \ndifferent categories of personnel, to ensure that each of judges, auxiliary \njudicial personnel and judicial administrative personnel is assigned to a \ndefinite post of duty and attends to his own duties. As of the end of 2018, the \nproportion of judges, auxiliary judicial personnel and judicial administrative \npersonnel had reached 34.6%, 49.5% and 15.9% respectively.\nFully implementing the judge quota system. In line with the principle \nof determining quota based on cases, selecting personnel based on job \nrequirements, controlling total number, and making overall planning at \nthe provincial level, through well-designed examination and assessment \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   136\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n137\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nprocedures, the courts nationwide have selected a total of 125,000 judges \nfrom the former 210,000 judges. The newly-selected judges are mainly \nplaced on adjudicative posts rather than general administrative posts, \nand over 85% of judicial personnel resource are allocated to trial work, \noptimized the resource allocation and the team structure. All higher people\u2019s \ncourt have strictly honored the maximum quota and ratio determined by the \nCentral Government, and according to the number of cases handled, and \nthe situations of economic and social development, population and other \nbasic figures of the places where the courts are located, the level of trial and \nfunctions of the courts, workloads of judges, staffing of auxiliary judicial \npersonnel and other factors, have implemented a system of unified allocation \nof judge quota among the courts at three levels within one provincial \njurisdiction and providing priority to the primary people\u2019s courts and the \narea where the conflicts between caseload and personnel is serious. Mainly \non the amount of cases, Guangdong courts decided that the proportion of \njudges should be lower than 30% in Shantou where there are fewer cases \nbut exceed personnel, and be higher than 50% in Shenzhen, Dongguan, \nZhongshan and other cities where there are overloaded cases but relatively \nfewer staffs. A mechanism of  exchange and removal of judges has been \nestablished, and a mechanism of dynamic management of quota has been \ngradually formed, whereby one may be appointed or removal as judge and \nan appointed judge may be promoted or demoted. As of June 2018, 5,938 \njudges nationwide have been removed due to  post transfer, reassignment, \nresignation, retirement, and disqulification, or the like.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   137\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n138\n-\n-\nReforming the judge selection and appointment system. The courts at \nthe provincial level have established judge selection committees comprising \njudge representatives and relevant civilians, and formulated open, fair \nand just judge selection and appointment procedures, to ensure that only \noutstanding legal practitioners who are upright in character and have rich \nexperience and a high professional level will become judge candidates. In \norder to improve the system of selection of judges level by level, in May \n2016, the Organization Department of the CCCPC, the Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt and the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate jointly promulgated the \nopinions on establishing the system of selection of judges and public \nprosecutors level by level, which express provide that the judges of the \npeople\u2019s courts at the prefecture level or above shall be selected level by \nlevel generally. In October 2015, the Supreme People\u2019s Court, after strict \nselection procedures, selected 7 outstanding judges from 62 applicants \nfrom local courts nationwide. In March 2014, the Supreme People\u2019s Court \nconducted a program of publicly selecting high-level judicial talents from \nexperts, scholars, lawyers and other personnel practicing law, and finally \nselected five persons, including experts, scholars, senior lawyers and \noutstanding public prosecutors, from 195 applicants. In 2015, the courts in \nShanghai publicly selected one judge from outside the judicature, and the \ncourts in Qinghai publicly selected three judges from outside the judicature. \nThe courts in Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian and other regions have begun to \nselect judges from outstanding judge assistants and send them to serve in the \nprimary people\u2019s courts.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   138\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n139\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\nReforming the rank of posts and compensation & benefit system \nof judges. A system of independent rank of posts of judges has been \nestablished so that: registered judges could be managed according to such \nindependent ranking order, judges\u2019 professional ranks are separated from \ntheir administrative ranks, and judges are promoted based on their seniority, \non a selective basis or specially; a personnel management system for \njudges that is different from that for other public servants and reflects the \nprofessional characteristics of judges has been implemented, which will \nbroaden the career development channels of grassroots judges and enhance \nthe professional honor and work enthusiasm of judges. As of the end of \n2018, all courts nationwide had established a mechanism for determining \nthe independent rank of posts of judges, about 98% courts had begun to \npromote judges along with their seniority, and about 52% courts had begun \nto promote judges on a selective basis. A compensation & benefit system \nhas been established, supporting the series of reforms of independent rank \nof posts of judges, and all courts nationwide have introduced the new salary \nsystem involving performance-based bonus, which greatly increased the \nsalary level of judges. By actively coordinating with  related departments \nof the Central Government, the Supreme People\u2019s Court has formulated \npolicies on post exchange, retirement age, medical benefit,, travel allowance, \ntraffic subsidy, and others benefits for judges, noticed those implementation \nof policies, and promoted the courts at all levels to effectively place these \npolicies.\n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   139\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n140\n-\n-\nReforming the system of recruiting and training auxiliary judicial \npersonnel. The Supreme People\u2019s Court, in cooperation with related \ndepartments of the Central Government, has issued opinion on recruiting \njudge assistants by people\u2019s courts. All regions have conducted unified \nindependent recruitment at provincial level in an orderly way, and steadily \nadvanced the position transfer of unadmitted judges and qualified clerks \nto judge assistant, to equip the courts with more judge assistants. In April \n2017, the Supreme People\u2019s Court, together with the Ministry of Finance \nand the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, launched a plan \nfor reforming the system on managing clerks, with a focus on the problems \nsolving that the management of contracted clerks was not standardized \nenough, the professional protection provided to contracted clerks is not \nstrong enough, and the team of contracted clerks is not stable enough. \nThe courts in all regions have expanded the sources of auxiliary judicial \npersonnel and explored the improvement of the system on managing and \ntraining auxiliary judicial personnel, with a focus on optimizing the structure \nof auxiliary judicial personnel. Since the reform, the number of auxiliary \njudicial personnel in Beijing courts has increased 68.8% from 2,689 to \n4,538; the ratio of number of judges to that of auxiliary judicial personnel \nin Shanghai courts has changed from 1:0.75 to 1:1.78. The Jiangsu Higher \nPeople\u2019s Court has vigorously pushed forward the reform of the clerk \nsystem, formulated the standards of the rank of posts of clerks and measures \nfor the training and evaluating clerks, properly defined the posts, the quantity \nand responsibilities of clerks, and provided that the proportion of first-line \njudges to clerks shall be 1:1.1, thereby changing the situation that  several \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   140\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:04\n\n\n141\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts\uff082013-2018\uff09\njudges assisted by one clerk in the past.\nEstablishing the legal research scholar and legal intern systems.

Most local courts have enhanced their cooperation with law \nschools and established a system of receiving  interns from law schools as \njudge assistants, who  participate in the auxiliary judicial work under the \nguidance of judges, alleviated the difficulty of understaffed judge assistants \nin the people\u2019s courts, and explored a new mode of classified management \nof judicial personnel. Chengdu Intermediate People\u2019s Court in Sichuan \nhas signed a cooperation agreement on  a mechanism of \u201c Judge Assistant \nInternship\u201d with 11 colleges and universities including Sichuan University, \nSouthwestern University of Finance and Economics and University of \nElectronic Science and Technology of China, by launching a program of \nintern judge assistants on campuses, whereby the colleges and universities \nin cooperation could select and send outstanding law graduates (or \nundergraduates) to participate in the auxiliary judicial work. So far, a total of \n304 interns of five phases have engaged in this program.\nStrengthening the professional ethics of the judiciary.

Junior judges are subject to \nprofessional qualification examination by provincial-level judge selection \ncommittees, and nomination, appointment and removal according to the \nlegal procedures by provincial-level governments in a centralized manner. \nThe provincial-level regions have also explored the reform of centralized \nfunding management system for local courts below provincial level in light \nof their respective local conditions. In 18 provinces, autonomous regions \nand municipalities directly governed by the Central Government such as \nBeijing, Tianjin and Shanxi and 2 cities specifically designated by the state \nplan namely Dalian and Shenzhen, the funds required by local courts below \nprovincial level are managed in a unified way by the provincial level, and \nall the courts at the provincial, municipal and county levels are classified as \nfirst-level budgetary units and prepare and submit their respective budgets \nto the provincial-level financial departments; their budgetary funds are \nappropriated from the central payment system of the Treasury.\nImproving the trial-level system. In order to adapt to the situations of \neconomic and social development, and reasonably defining the respective \nfunctions of the courts at four levels, the Supreme People\u2019s Court \nadjusted the thresholds for the jurisdiction of the higher people\u2019s courts \n\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013-2018\uff09.indd   149\n2019/03/01,\u661f\u671f\u4e94   17:42:05\n\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff082013\u20142018\uff09\n150\n-\n-\nand intermediate people\u2019s courts over civil and commercial cases of first \ninstance, and increased the threshold of the subject value of civil and \ncommercial cases of first instance under the jurisdiction of primary people\u2019s \ncourts; provided that major, difficult and complicated cases, new types of \ncases and typical cases in terms of application of law may be adjudicated \nby a people\u2019s court at a higher level as determined by it in its sole discretion \nor at the request of a people\u2019s court at a lower level. In February 2015, the \nSupreme People\u2019s Court promulgated the judicial interpretations on issues \nconcerning strict application of order for retrial and remand for retrial in the \nsupervisory procedure for the trial of civil cases, which unify the standard \nfor order for retrial and review of cases, strictly prohibit remand for retrial \nat will, and request that if a people\u2019s court at a higher level orders to retry a \ncase or remands a case for retrial, it shall elaborate in the ruling the detailed \nreasons for such order for retrial or remand for retrial.\nConducting pilot reform of trans-regional centralized jurisdiction over \nadministrative cases.
